The component is used as an active state of a trigger in filters.

## Usage with Select

Replace the `tag` for the `Select.Trigger`.

<script lang="tsx" src="examples/usage_with_select.tsx"></script>

## Usage with Dropdown

It is more complex example with [Dropdown](/components/dropdown/dropdown) and [Counter](/components/counter/counter). It is recommended to use it for **advanced filters** where it is important to show that there are several additional filters inside.
