## What component has

When dropdown is closed, the focus returns to the trigger.

### Keyboard support

User can navigate inside the list with the keyboard arrows.

| Key              | Function                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`            | Moves focus to the next focusable element.     |
| `Shift + Tab`    | Moves focus to the previous focusable element. |
| `Space`, `Enter`, `Down Arrow` | When focus is on the trigger, opens the dropdown.                                                                                         |
| `Up Arrow`, `Down Arrow`            | Moves focus between the options in the dropdown. If focus is on the last/first option, moves focus to the first/last option respectively. |
| `Space`, `Enter`               | Selects the option and closes the dropdown.                                                                                               |
| `Esc`            | Closes the dropdown.                           |

See detailed information for the controlling dropdown with the keyboard in the [Keyboard control guide](/core-principles/a11y/a11y-keyboard#keyboard_support_for_popper).

### Roles & attributes

The list below describes roles and attributes that component already has.

| Role | Attribute    | Element | Usage                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `combobox` |        | `div`   | The `combobox` role identifies an element as an input that controls another element, such as a `listbox` or `grid`, that can dynamically pop up to help the user set the value of that input. |
|      | `aria-label` | `div`   | The `aria-label` attribute defines a string value that labels an interactive element.                                                                   |
|      | `tabIndex`   | `div`   | Makes the trigger focusable and includes it in the page `Tab` sequence. This approach to managing focus is described in the section on roving tabindex. |
