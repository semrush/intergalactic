::: warning
:rotating_light: `Table` component is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Use [DataTable](/table-group/data-table/data-table) instead.
:::

Our library has two components for tables:

- `Table` component is the old one.
- `DataTable` component is completely new, built with CSS flex and doesn't use native tables.

**We recommend you to use `DataTable` component**

## Examples

- For the old `Table` component, refer to the [Table (old)](/table-group/table-old/).
- For `DataTable` component, refer to the [DataTable](/table-group/data-table/data-table).
