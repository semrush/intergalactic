@## Description

**NeighborLocation** is a component for grouping components. It indicates where the component is in relation to its neighbors.

> ðŸ™ƒ This violates many principles of building components, but the beautiful API and the necessary functionality outweighed the valuations.

For example, you can group together:

- [Button](/components/button/)
- [Input](/components/input/)
- [Select](/components/select)

You may also need a `flex-box` to align the components. For more information, see the [Flex-box and indent system](/layout/box-system/).

@## Grouped buttons

Buttons can be grouped.

If you group primary buttons, the right one will have a 1px white border.

If you group secondary buttons, the left one will hide it's right border.

> Do not group tertiary buttons this way.

@example neighbor-location

@## Grouped input and button

@example neighbor-location-input

@## Grouped input and select

@example neighbor-location-input-select

@## Grouped input, select, and button

You can group input, select, and button.

@## Adding a wrapper

By default, `<NeighborLocation/>` does not create an HTML wrapper, but you can pass the component tag you want.

> For the correct type mapping in the TC, you must also pass the interface.
> `<NeighborLocation<IFlexProps> tag={Flex} w={200}/>`

@example neighbor-location-with-tag
