@## Description

**Filter Click Potential** is a filter to sort the data on the page by the Click Potential parameter.

**Filter Competitive Density** is a filter to sort the data on the page by the Competitive Density parameter.

**Filter CPC** is a filter to sort the data on the page by the CPC parameter.

They contain only a field for a custom range value, there is no preset data, since click potetntial, competitive density and cost per click are very individual parameters for each instrument.

**When working with these filters, it is important for the user to:**

- quickly enter the data it needs;
- quickly understand that nothing was found;
- quickly reset the entered data and search again;
- be able to change data.

@## Appearance

### Trigger

**Set the trigger min-width to 80px**. It's not recommended to make the trigger smaller. When there is enough space in the interface, make the width of the trigger dependent on the content, so the text inside the trigger doesn't have to be collapsed into the `ellipsis`.

### Dropdown

**Don't make a dropdown width less than 224px**, otherwise the maximum possible values will not fit into the Custom range inputs.

| CPC                 | ![opened cpc](static/opened.png) ![filled cpc](static/filled.png)     |

@## Custom range

- If the filter has the ability to select a custom period, then use [InputNumber](/components/input-number/) for this.
- Stepper buttons appear when you hover over an input.

The behavior and appearance of the stepper buttons is described in the [Filters, common rules](/filter-group/filter-rules/) guide.

@## Interaction

When you open a dropdown, the focus immediately goes to the first Custom range field.

Working and interacting with the filter are described in detail in the [Filters, common rules](/filter-group/filter-rules/) guide.

@## Tooltips
