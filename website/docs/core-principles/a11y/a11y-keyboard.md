title: Keyboard support
---

Make sure that it's possible to interact with the interface using a keyboard only.

- Check the focus on the site using the `Tab` key to make sure that it correctly navigates between the interface elements.
- Check if the interaction with forms and links using the `Enter` and `Space` keys works correctly.
- Check that it's possible to cancel actions and close modal windows with the `Esc` key
- Use hotkeys on the website.
- Avoid overriding hotkeys. For example, don't override `Control+C` (or `Command+C` on Mac).
- Use HTML specification and always include attributes and roles.
- When opening a modal window, focus should move to the window, and then return to the page.
- The user expects that the focus between elements will switch in a logical order, usually from left to right and from top to bottom.

@## Basic rules

> **Brief guide to keyboard control**
>
> - **Tab** moves `focus` between the interactive elements on the page / in the dropdown / modal window, etc.
> - **Shift** + **Tab** returns `focus` to the previous interactive element. If dropdown is open, it closes.
> - **Enter**, **Space** or **â†“** **(for the select/menu trigger)** opens a dropdown. And if it has interactive elements inside, `focus` moves to the first one.
> - **â†“** inside the dropdown moves `focus` to the next `menuItem`. From the last `menuItem`, the `focus` moves to the first `menuItem`. The same logic applies to the **â†‘** key, but backwards ðŸ™ƒ
> - **Esc** closes the dropdown. If the `focus` was on the control inside the dropdown, `Esc` removes the `focus` from the interactive element and closes the dropdown.

Keyboard control should be performed sequentially across all interactive elements (which have focus) on the page.

- The focus state for all controls appears by pressing the `Tab` key.
- For inputs and text fields, focus also appears by `onClick`.
- When navigating the keyboard all controls are highlighted with a blue border (see [Variables](/style/variables/#ab8464)). Exceptions are inputs and text fields when validating, that on focus have same border color (orange or green).
- The focus inside groups of controls is consistent. After the last control in the group, the focus should move to the next control in the interface.
- If the control has a tooltip in the `hover` state, it also appears on focus using `Tab`.

@## Keyboard support for button, link, input, etc.

### Link Ð¸ hint link

- Links get focus by clicking on `Tab`.
- Links are highlighted with a blue border (see [Variables](/style/variables/#ab8464)).
- When you press `Enter`, the link is clicked or an action is performed.

### Button

- Buttons get focus only by pressing the `Tab` key.
- Buttons are highlighted with a blue outline when focused on, regardless of the button color.
- When you press `Enter`, the link is clicked or an action is performed.

### Input Ð¸ textarea

- Input fields get focus by pressing the `Tab` key.
- When focused, the fields are highlighted with a blue outline. For fields that have been validated, the outline corresponds to the border color (e.g., orange).
- The target action is performed by pressing `Enter` (saving, applying a filter, etc.).

### Checkbox, radio Ð¸ switch

- Selection controls get focus when you press `Tab`.
- When focused, the controls are highlighted with a blue outline. For controls that have been validated, the outline corresponds to the border color (e.g., orange).
- When you press `Enter`, an element is enabled/disabled, depending on the initial state.

### Any other controls (FilterTrigger, Pills, TabLine Ð¸ Ð¿Ñ€.)

- The control gets focus when you press `Tab`.
- When focused, controls are highlighted with a blue outline, regardless of the color of the control.
- When you press `Enter`, an event occurs. _For example, a dropdown opens._
- If a tooltip should appear on hovering over the control, then when pressing `Tab`, it will appear when focused.

### Images as links or clickable groups

- These elements get focus by pressing the `Tab`.
- If all elements of a group perform the same action when clicked, the entire group is highlighted as a single element when focused.
- When you press `Enter`, the link is clicked or an action is performed.

### Table

- Cells and controls inside get focus using `Tab` only.
- Both rows and single elements in a row get `focus`. Besides, the rows are presented as a list and you can move through them with arrows. And inside rows â€” using `Tab`.
- When a cell/control gets `focus`, it is highlighted with a blue outline.
- When you press `Enter`, an event occurs, as if you press the mouse button. If the entire row have `focus`, you follow the link, and if only the icon has `focus`, then the action is performed, etc.

@## Keyboard support for dropdown

Particular cases about focus behavior when working with dropdown are described below. _If you see that some of them are missing, please drop us a line._

@## Focus, OnClick and dropdown

1. By clicking/pressing `Tab`, the trigger gets focus.
2. When the trigger is focused, pressing `Enter`/`Space` opens a dropdown.
3. If the trigger opens the select, you can also use the arrow down `â†“` to move to dropdown.
4. Pressing `Esc` key closes the dropdown, and focus remains on the trigger.

`Shift + Tab` moves focus to the previous control, and popper closes.

@## Focus, OnMouseEnter and dropdown

1. By hovering over / pressing `Tab`, the focus falls on the trigger â€” popper opens immediately.
2. The dropdown closes by pressing `Esc`, and **focus remains on the trigger**.
3. `Shift + Tab` moves focus to the previous control, and popper closes.

@## Focus, OnClick and dropdown with a single interactive element

1. By clicking/pressing `Tab`, the trigger gets focus.
2. When you focus on trigger, `Enter`/`Space` opens a dropdown. If the trigger opens a select/menu, you can also switch to popper by using the `â†“` arrow.
3. Pressing `Shift + Tab` closes the popper and returns focus to the trigger.
4. Pressing `Esc` closes the dropdown, even if the focus was on the control inside the dropdown. After closing the dropdown, focus remains on the trigger.
5. Clicking on the `Submit` control inside the dropdown closes it and returns focus to the trigger.
6. If you focus on the control inside the dropdown, the `Tab` click will move focus back to the trigger. And so it cycles in a circle until the dropdown is closed with `Esc`.

@## Focus, OnClick and dropdown with multiple interactive elements

1. By clicking/pressing `Tab`, the trigger gets focus.
2. When you focus on trigger, `Enter`/`Space` opens a dropdown. If the trigger opens a select/menu, then you can also shift to the dropdown using the `â†“` arrow.
3. `â†“` in the menu shifts the focus to the next `menuItem`. From the last `menuItem`, the focus moves to the first `menuItem`. The same logic applies to the `â†‘` key, but backwards ðŸ™ƒ
4. You can use `Shift + Tab` to return to the previous control inside the dropdown.
5. Pressing `Esc` closes the dropdown, even if the focus was on the control inside the dropdown. After closing the dropdown, focus remains on the trigger.
6. `Shift + Tab` returns to the control that opened the dropdown.
7. Clicking the `Submit` control in the dropdown closes it and leaves the focus on the trigger.
8. If focus is on controls inside the dropdown, clicking on `Tab` will move the focus back to the trigger. And so forth and so on until the dropdown is closed using `Esc`.

@## Focus, onClick and dropdown in the dropdown

A dropdown inside another dropdown has the same situation as in the above case.
