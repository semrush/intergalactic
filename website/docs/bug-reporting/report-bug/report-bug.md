title: Bug reporting
---

Have you found a bug in the one of our components and don't know where or to whom to write? 🤷🏻‍♀️ We have some ways to report bugs.

@## Report with Github issues

Submit a bug/request for an improvement in the [Github through issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).

- Convenient for the developers and maintainers of the design system.
- Saves the history of changes and discussions of all components.
- Maybe inconvenient for designers and other departments, since not everyone has a Github account.

@## Report with internal Slack chat

Use internal Slack chat (**#ui-kit-team**) to report and discuss bugs, improvements and other questions you want to address the Semrush UI Kit Team.

- Convenient for Semrush developers and other maintainers, because of quick feedback, quick fix of bugs, finding solutions to problems, discussion.
- Remember, that Slack chat isn't very helpful in terms of saving history.
