title: Bug reporting
---

Have you found a bug in the one of our components and don't know where or to whom to write? 🤷🏻‍♀️ We have some ways to report bugs

@## 1. Report with Github issues

Submit a bug/request for an improvement in the [Github through issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests)

- Convenient for the developers and maintainers of the design system.
- Convenient, since there is a history of changes and discussions of all components.
- Maybe inconvenient for designers and other departments, since not everyone has a Github account.

@## 2. Report with internal Slack chat

Use internal Slack chat (#ui-kit-team) to report and discuss bugs, improvements and other questions you want to address the Semrush UI Kit Team.

- Convenient for Semrush developers and other maintainers, because of quick feedback, quick fix of bugs, finding solutions to problems, discussion.
- Remember, that Slack chat isn't very helpful in terms of saving history, you can lose the history of discussions.
