@## Color and contrast

![contrast](/core-principles/a11y/static/contrast.png)

**Requirements**:

- **Make sure that there is sufficient contrast between the text color and the background**.

- **Make sure that the minimum contrast ratio is 4.5:1**. For enlarged text, you can lower the contrast to 3:1. Enlarged text is text with a minimum size of 18 points in normal or 14 points in bold. There are some exceptions:

  - Logos or decorative elements on the page
  - Inactive controls

- **Make sure to use additional ways of communication or markup besides color**. This is important for colorblind users. For example, highlighting a field in red will not inform the user about an error if they can't differ colors.

> **Don't rely on color as your only visual medium**. Use bold, asterisks, icons, typography, text, check required boxes, etc.
