Design tokens are variables that store visual design choices. With design tokens, designers and developers can quickly access and apply a range of visual attributes for any given element in a UI. This approach helps design and developer process to be unified and consistent across all products.

@## Base tokens

Our palette is built with [Huetone tool](https://huetone.ardov.me/). You can learn more in the [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ardovalexey/status/1447329411678806023).

Shades of the same color have a value ranging from 50 to 800, depending on its tone. Each shade has recommendations for use based on Huetone's contrast ratio calculation.

@## Semantic tokens
