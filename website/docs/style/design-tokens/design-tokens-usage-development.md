@## Use for global states

Design tokens are ideal for global states because they help ensure consistent visual representation and behavior across the design system. Using design tokens for global states also makes it easier to update and maintain the product, as changes can be made in a centralized location.

@## Don't use for local states

It's important to use design tokens only for global states because using them for local states or specific instances can lead to inconsistencies within the design system and may require more effort to maintain. Besides, using tokens only for a certain component will cause changes to be applied to the internal content of the component as well, which may be unnecessary.

If you do need to make pointed changes, then instead of using design tokens, you need to use sstyled and apply the styles directly to the component.

Additionally, using design tokens only for global states helps to maintain modularity in the product. Design tokens can be thought of as the building blocks that make up the larger design system, and by using them only for global states, designers and developers can focus on creating specific, localized styles using these building blocks.

@## Why it should be used only for global states

Furthermore, by using design tokens only for global states, organizations can ensure that their design system remains flexible and adaptable to change. As the design system evolves, updates can be made to the design tokens, which will then be reflected in all relevant places throughout the design system. This allows for a centralized approach to updating the design system, making it easier to maintain consistency and ensure that all updates are made in a controlled and deliberate manner.

To sum up, using design tokens only for global states is a best practice because it promotes consistency, maintainability, modularity, and adaptability in the design system.

If you can't find the token you are looking for, then please double-check again. If it is really missing, you can come to us with a request to add a new token.
