> Make sure that the user can easily read the text on the page.

@## Accessibility considerations

- **Use a font size sufficient for comfortable reading**. The minimal font size for the body text is 16 pixels, but this size may vary depending on the font style.

- **Set the paragraph width for comfortable reading**. Don't make paragraphs too long or too short: 45 to 75 characters is an acceptable length, 66 is optimal. Shorter text is good for forms, image captions, and marginal notes.

- **Choose a legible font**. It's recommended to use sans serif fonts for interfaces and serif fonts for long documents, but this is not an absolute rule. Make sure that your font:

  - Reads well regardless of the scale
  - Has large-height lowercase letters (x-height)
  - Is sufficiently large in the selected size
  - Has constant parameters for letter forms (lowercase letter height and other parameters)
  - Has unique characters that cannot be confused with each other, for example `0` and `O`
  - Supports all necessary symbols and styles

- **Use headings to draw the user's attention to the hierarchy**. Make sure that the headings differ from the main text in size, thickness, style, and color. This will ensure visual consistency and readability against the background of the main text.

- **Determine the height of the text for optimal reading**. The larger the font size and line thickness, the larger the spacing should be. For the body text, the spacing to font size ratio should be around 1.4–1.65, for headings — 1–1.3, for captions and short lines — around 1.3. Lines that are spaced too tightly or too loosely make text less readable, so finding a new line becomes more difficult.

conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
(Level A)

[Text Spacing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#text-spacing) - In content implemented using markup languages, no loss
of content or functionality occurs. (Level AA)

[Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#contrast-minimum) - The visual presentation of
text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for some cases. (Level AA)

[Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=131#resize-text) - Except for captions and
images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to
200 percent without loss of content or functionality. (Level AA)

[Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=131#images-of-text) - If the
technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey
information rather than images of text. (Level AA)
