## Basic usage

Our typography primitives have no margins as they may differ in the end products. You may add them yourself according to your specific requirements.

## Native typography tags

To style native tags, use the `FormatText` component from the `intergalactic/format-text` package.

It's acceptable to style third-party HTML. However, in other cases, we recommend using the `Text` component.

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/native-typography-tags.tsx';
</script>

## FormatText nested lists

For proper nested ordered lists counting, you need to explicitly specify the `start`, `reversed`, or `type` attribute.

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/formattext-nested-lists.tsx';
</script>

## Hint with button role

For `Hint` with `role=button` your need to add `onKeyDown` handler yourself for correct working from the keyboard.

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/hint-with-button-role.tsx';
</script>
