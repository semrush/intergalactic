## Basic usage

The following heading styles are an example of a text scale that used for product landing pages and text-heavy pages. You can set any heading level to text of any `size`. However, we recommend setting heading levels on the page so that the visual hierarchy matches the heading hierarchy in the code.

Our typography primitives donâ€™t have predefined margins, as these may vary in the final interface. You can add margins as needed based on your specific layout requirements.

::: info
H5 and H6 are shown here for illustrative purposes. **We recommend avoiding the use of more than 4 heading levels in the interface.**

## Text styling

You can style text by changing its color, font-weight, font-style, text-transform, and even changing its font-family to `monospace`.

## Custom list bullets

You can add custom bullets to our `List.Item` component.

## Native typography tags

To style native tags, use the `Text` component from the `@semcore/typography` package.

Styling third-party HTML is acceptable, but for other cases, we recommend using the `Text` component without native tags inside.

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from 'stories/components/typography/docs/examples/native-typography-tags.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Nested lists

For correct numbering in nested ordered lists, you must explicitly specify the `start`, `reversed`, or `type` attribute.

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from 'stories/components/typography/docs/examples/formattext-nested-lists.tsx';
</script>

## Hint with button role

::: warning
The [ButtonLink](../../components/button/button-code#button-looking-like-link) component has been implemented to replace the `Hint` component. Using `Hint` as a button or a pseudo-link is no longer recommended.
