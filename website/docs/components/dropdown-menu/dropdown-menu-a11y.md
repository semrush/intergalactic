| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`                            | Moves focus to the next focusable element.                                                                           |
| `Shift + Tab`                    | Moves focus to the previous focusable element.                                                                       |
| `Space`, `Enter`, <nobr>`Up Arrow`</nobr>, <nobr>`Down Arrow`</nobr> | When focus is on the trigger, opens the dropdown.                                |
| <nobr>`Up Arrow`</nobr>, <nobr>`Down Arrow`</nobr> | Moves selection between the list options in the dropdown. If selection is on the last/first option, moves selection to the first/last option respectively. |
| `Space`, `Enter`                 | Selects the option and closes the dropdown.                                                                          |
| `Esc`                            | Closes the dropdown.                                                                                                 |

When dropdown is closed, the focus stays on the trigger.

| `DropdownMenu.Menu`                              | `menu`                       | The `menu` role is a type of composite widget that offers a list of choices to the user.            |

| `DropdownMenu.Item`, `DropdownMenu.Item.Content` | `menuitem`                   | Indicates the element is an option in a set of choices contained by a `menu`.       |

## Considerations for developers

Only use `DropdownMenu.Popper` explicitly if it must have additional elements beside the menu, as in [the example with a Notice](./dropdown-menu-code.md#second-method). In that case the popper will be presented as a dialog, which hints to the screen reader user to use the `Tab` key to navigate between the menu and other elements.

If your `DropdownMenu` is a list of options without additional features, use it with `DropdownMenu.Menu`, as in the [basic example](./dropdown-menu-code.md#basic-usage). This will let the screen reader user know that `Up` and `Down` keys are enough to navigate within the control.

### Roles and attributes

The following list will help you to keep in mind the necessary roles and attributes to make our components fully accessible in the particular cases in your interfaces.

Table: Roles and attributes

| Component             | Attribute                         | Usage                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DropdownMenu.Popper` | `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | **Only if `DropdownMenu.Popper` is used explicitly.** Defines an accessible name for the popper. |
