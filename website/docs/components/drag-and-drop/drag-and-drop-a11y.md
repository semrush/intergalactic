Table: Roles and attributes

| Role    | Attribute                      | Element | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alert` |                                | `div` | Identifies the element as the container where alert content will be added or updated.                                                                                                                                               |
|         | `aria-live="assertive"` | `div` | This doesn't have to be declared in the code because it is implicit in the alert role. Tells assistive technologies to interrupt other processes to provide users with immediate notification of relevant alert container changes. |
|         | `tabIndex="0"` | `div` | Makes the elements focusable and includes them in the page `Tab` sequence.                                                                                                                                                          |

| Item is grabbing over area without any items    | `Grabbing ${itemText}, drop in ${zoneName}`                                                |
