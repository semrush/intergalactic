## Description

**Drag and drop** is a component that allows user to move elements within the interface, changing their order and sometimes their properties.

::: tip
One common use for drag and drop is a dropdown with a list of table columns that can be reordered, usually titled **Table settings** or **Manage columns**.
:::

The component imitates physically dragging objects, and two essential considerations for this are:

- Clearly indicate which interface elements can be dragged and where.
- Provide visual cues during dragging to show that the element is being moved and where it can be placed.

### Component composition

The component consists of the following parts:

1. `DragAndDrop` is a container for `Draggable` elements and related `DropZone` elements.
2. `DragAndDrop.DropZone` is where the element can be dropped.
3. `DragAndDrop.Draggable` is the element you can move.

## Grabbing

| State description | Illustration |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Drag indicators are hidden in the default state.  | ![](static/drag-default.png)  |
| Drag indicator appears when the draggable object is hovered or focused.  | ![](static/drag-hover.png)  |
| When the grab area is hovered, mouse cursor turns into `grab`.  | ![](static/hover-grab.png)  |
| When the object is grabbed, mouse cursor turns into `grabbed`, the object box-shadow changes to `--box-shadow-dnd`.  | ![](static/dragging.png)  |

Drag indicator can be placed vertically, as in list items, or horizontally, as in cards.

## Dragging

Dragging trajectory isnâ€™t restricted, allowing the element to be moved freely between its original position and the drop zone.

## Dropping

| State description | Illustration |
|-------------------|--------------|
| In the default state, the drop zone is marked with `border: 1px dashed var(--border-primary)`. Display text with `--text-secondary` color inside the zone to describe what can be dropped there. <br/><br/>When nothing is dragged, the drop zone isn't interactive and its styles don't change on hover. | ![](static/drop-zone-default.png)  |
| When an object is dragged over the drop zone, if the object was dragged from another area, the drop zone background changes to `--bg-primary-neutral-hover`.  | ![](static/drag-card.png)  |
| When rearranging objects in a list or grid, the drop zone is created dynamically by pushing apart neighbouring objects. In this case, the drop zone background is `--bg-secondary-neutral-hover`.  | ![](static/dragging.png)  |
| If the drop zone under the dragged object is unavailable, mouse cursor changes to `not-allowed`.  | ![](static/no-drop.png)  |
