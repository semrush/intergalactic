Table: Keyboard support

| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

| `Esc`         | Closes the panel.                         |

See detailed information about the keyboard support for the clickable elements in the [Keyboard control guide](/core-principles/a11y/a11y-keyboard#keyboard_support_for_button_link_input_etc).

### Default attributes

Table: Default attributes

| Component               | Attribute               | Usage                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `SidePanel`             | `role="dialog"`         | Identifies the element as a dialog, indicating to assistive technology that its content is grouped and separated from the rest of the page content. |
| `SidePanel`             | `aria-modal="true"`     | Tells assistive technologies that the content underneath the current dialog is not available for interaction. |
| `SidePanel.Close`       | `aria-label="Close"`    | Sets the default accessible name for the **Close** button.     |

## Considerations for developers and designers

- It's required to set either the `aria-label` or the `aria-labelledby` attribute for the `SidePanel` component. If your `SidePanel` has a visible title, it's best to reference it in the `aria-labelledby` attribute.
- Make sure to use correct heading tags and hierarchy for titles in `SidePanel`.
