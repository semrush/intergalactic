## Considerations for designers & developers

1. If you're using the Carousel to display images, make sure to add alt text to each image so assistive technologies can announce the slides properly.
2. If you're using the Carousel to display a set of cards, don't forget to associate the items with the cards using `aria-labelledby`.
3. You can add a specific `aria-label` to the button that wraps the slide when the `zoom` property is set to `true`. In our examples, the default label is "Open in fullscreen" ([refer to the examples](/components/carousel/carousel-code)).

## Auto-play

We don't recommend adding auto-play to the Carousel component at all.

::: tip
If you decide to add it, make sure to include a pause button that's keyboard accessible and has an appropriate `aria-label` if it's not visible.
