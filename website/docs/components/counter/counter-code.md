@## Counter in filters
[FilterTrigger](/components/filter-trigger/) is normally used together with [Select](/components/select/) or [Dropdown](/components/dropdown/). Go to [the guide](/components/filter-trigger/) for more information.

@example counter-filter

@## Counter in Button

> Don't forget to place counters inside the `Addon` to create correct margins.

@example counter-button

@## Counter in forms

> As design guide recommends, the counter changes color to orange and then red when the limit is reached and exceeded, respectively. This rule is not implemented in the example.

@example counter-textarea

@## Counter and typography

The text counters shall be implemented using [Typography](/style/typography) without using the `Counter` component.
