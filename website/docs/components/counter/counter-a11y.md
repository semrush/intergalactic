Counter is a straight-forward component that does not require special compliance for accessibility.

@## Considerations for designers

- Counter text should be clear and concise.
- Make sure to [check the contrast of the counter text against the background](/style/palette/palette-a11y/).

@## Other recommendations

See more accessibility recommendations in the common [Accessibility guide](/core-principles/a11y/#contrast).
