## Known country, but the number format is unknown

The input field has a preset value: "+ {country code}". However, if it is possible to enter phone numbers from multiple countries, a country select option should be provided instead of a static flag.

::: tip
In certain countries, there may be multiple valid formats for phone numbers. Therefore, it is sometimes safer to remove the format mask to avoid restricting user input.
