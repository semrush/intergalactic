@## The country is known but the number format is not known

The input has a preset value: + country code. However, if it is possible to enter phone numbers from several countries, a country select option shall be available instead of static flag.

> In some countries, there may be several valid formats for phone numbers. Therefore, it is sometimes safer to remove the format mask so as not to restrict user input.

@example medium

@## We know the country and number format

This option is suitable when you collect phones from users from one or a limited number of countries.
