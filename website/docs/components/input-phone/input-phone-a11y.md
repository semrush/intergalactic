For accessibility documentation, refer to the components used in the InputPhone pattern:

- [Input A11y](/components/input/input-a11y)
- [Select A11y](/components/select/select-a11y)
- [Flags A11y](/components/flags/flags-a11y)

## Considerations for developers

Make sure the browser's autofill feature works correctly in phone inputs, and the appropriate virtual keyboard is displayed on focus. Usually, this is done by adding `type="tel"` and `autocomplete="tel"` attributes, as [in the examples](./input-phone-code.md).

## Other recommendations

Find more accessibility recommendations in the common [Accessibility guide](/core-principles/a11y/a11y).
