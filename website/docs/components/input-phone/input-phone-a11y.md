### Keyboard support

| Key           | Function                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`         | Moves focus to the next focusable element.     |
| `Shift + Tab` | Moves focus to the previous focusable element. |
| `Enter`       | Submits the entered value.                     |

See detailed information about the keyboard support for the input fileds in the [Keyboard control guide](/core-principles/a11y/a11y-keyboard/#input_i_textarea).

@## Considerations for developers

- Keep it simple — not all browsers correctly expose multiple labels that are linked to the same form element.
- Use labels for every input and make the `for=""` and `id=""` values match. IDs must be unique on each page, only one label can be associated to each unique form element. Make required fields obvious by using an indicator — border color change, asterisk, description text, etc.
- Fields with error validation should have `aria-describedby` to insure that the associated field level error message is read by assistive technology. If the error message has an `id="my-error-message"`, then the input should have `aria-describedby="my-error-message"`.

@## Considerations for designers

- Focus must be visible.
- Don’t hide the input label on focus.
