## Considerations for developers

The `Flags` component doesn't have an `aria-label` by default to avoid double reading when it's accompanied by the country name.

If you use `Flags` without the full country name, you should set the following attributes to the component:

- `aria-label` with the full country name,
- `role="image"`.

If you use `Flags` with the short country code, do the same, and also hide the country code with `aria-hidden`.
