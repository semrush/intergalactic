@## Description

**Sticky** is a component that can be used to pin a block towards a parent one when scrolling.

The block can either be centered in relation to the height and width of the parent block or pinned with a certain margin the top, bottom, left and right sides of the parent block.

> Pinned messages allow user not to lose important messages about loading, data collection, limitations on viewing and errors in working with data when scrolling a page.

@example limit

@## Pinning of header and columns in table

When scrolling a table, pin its header. Do not add have any shadows to pinned table header.

If there is a status bar or a table row with quick actions, then pin them under the table header.

In some cases, it is necessary to pin the first one or two columns in the table. Do not forget to add shadows to then when scrolling, so that the user can see that there is more content.

Shadow has the following styles:

```
background-image: linear-gradient(to left, rgba(25, 27, 35, .1), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0));
```
