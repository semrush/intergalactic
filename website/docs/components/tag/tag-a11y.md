## Considerations for developers

- Make sure screenreader reads your tags list as a group. Refer to [Grouping tags example](link will be here).
- Interactive tags that are used as a button for filtering content should also follow the accessibility guidelines for [Button](/components/button/button-a11y).

## Considerations for designers

- Tag text should be clear and concise.
- Make sure to [check the contrast of the tag text against the background](/core-principles/a11y/a11y-design#color_and_contrast). Refer to [section about Tag colors](/components/tag/tag#tag-colors).
- Tag that is used as a link for filtering content should also follow the accessibility guidelines for [Link component](/components/link/link-a11y).
