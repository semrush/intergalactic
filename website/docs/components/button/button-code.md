## Addons

Addons can be installed either by passing the required `tag` to the `addonLeft`/`addonRight` property or by unrending `Button.Addon`/`Button.Text` into the component body. The examples below are the same.

@example addon

## Button with Icon

To use a button with a single icon, you need to wrap it in an `<Button.Addon/>`.

@example one-addon

## Button accessibility

If there is no text in the button, it is necessary to add aria-label with a button description.

@example a11y
