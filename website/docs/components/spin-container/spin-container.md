@## Description

**SpinContainer** is a component for displaying [spinner](/components/spin/) around a component block.

@## Appearance

The spinner is always placed in the center of the container. For larger blocks (e.g. you have a whole page loaded), wrap the spinner in [Sticky](/components/sticky/), so that it is centered on the user's viewport.

Mask transparency in SpinContainer is 0.85

@## Use in UX/UI

You can control the status of the [spinner](/components/spin/) and use it as a container.

It is possible to use SpinContainer as a container for blocking the form interface.
