@## Considerations for developers

- Make sure you have tabbing focus indicators for all elements that should be controlled.
- Every `<img>` needs an `alt` attribute. If the image is informational, set the `alt` text as a descriptive alternative for the image.
- If the image is decorative, set `alt=""`, so it will be ignored by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
- Avoid using generic strings like photo, image, or icon as `alt` values, as they donâ€™t communicate valuable content to the user. Be as descriptive as possible.
- You can add `class="visuallyhidden"` with descriptive text to give more context to a button or link's purpose.
