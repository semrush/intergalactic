## What component has

### Roles and attributes

Table: Roles & attributes

| Attribute               | Usage                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-busy="true"`      | Indicates that the element is being modified and that assistive technologies may want to wait until the changes are complete before informing the user about the update. |
| `aria-label="Loadingâ€¦"` | Sets an accessible name for the element.                   |

## Considerations for developers and designers

- When displaying `Skeleton` in place of a heading, avoid semantic heading markup, as this can make navigation confusing for screen reader users.
- Place `Skeleton` inside a container with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` attributes for the screen reader to announce the start of the loading process ([example](./skeleton-code#text-initial-loading)).

## Resources

- Detailed information about `aria-busy` state you can find in the [W3's guide](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-busy).
- [MDN's guide for aria-busy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-busy) describes core information for this state.
