Table: Roles & attributes

| Attribute               | Element              | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-busy="true"`      | Implicit on `svg`    | The `aria-busy` state indicates an element is being modified and that assistive technologies may want to wait until the changes are complete before informing the user about the update. |
| `aria-label="Loadingâ€¦"` | Implicit on `svg`    | The `aria-label` attribute sets the element description that will be announced by the assistive technologies.                                                                            |

Skeleton is an `svg` element. It contains `foreignObject` with a `span` element inside. The `span` element has a `role="status"`, `aria-atomic="true"` and `aria-live="polite"` attribute. These attributes are used to inform assistive technologies about the loading state.

## Considerations for developers and designers

- When displaying skeleton in place of a heading, avoid semantic heading markup, as this can make navigation confusing for screen reader users.

## Resources

- Detailed information about `aria-busy` state you can find in the [W3's guide](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-busy).
- [MDN's guide for aria-busy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-busy) describes core information for this state.
