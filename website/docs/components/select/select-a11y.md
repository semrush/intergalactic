> #### General recommendations
>
> - The `<fieldset>` surrounds the entire grouping of checkboxes or radio buttons. The `<legend>` provides a description for the grouping.
> - Some assistive technology reads the legend text for each fieldset, so it should be brief and descriptive. This helps someone using assistive technology to understand the question they are answering with the group of radio buttons.
> - For select elements with groups of options, the `optgroup` element can be used to indicate such groups. The `label` attribute of the `optgroup` element is used to provide a label for the group. This is especially useful for lists with many related options.
