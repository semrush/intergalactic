See detailed information about the keyboard support for the inputs in the [Keyboard control guide](/core-principles/a11y/a11y-keyboard#input_i_textarea).

## Considerations for developers

- Use labels for every input and make the `for=""` and `id=""` values match. IDs must be unique on each page, only one label can be associated to each unique form element. Keep it simple â€“ do not all browsers correctly expose multiple labels that are linked to the same form element. [Refer to our examples](/components/input/input-code).
- Make optional fields obvious by adding text "optional" to the input.
- Inputs with the `invalid` state should be associated with their error message using `aria-describedby`.

## Resources
