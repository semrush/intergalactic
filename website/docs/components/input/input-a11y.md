> ### General recommendations
>
> - Keep it simple - not all browsers correctly expose multiple labels that are linked to the same form element.
> - Use labels for every input and make the `for=""` and `id=""` values match. IDs must be unique on each page, only one label can be associated to each unique form element.
>   Make required fields obvious by using an indicator â€” border color change, asterisk, description text, etc.
> - Fields with error validation should have `aria-describedby` to insure that the associated field level error message is read by assistive technology. If the error message has an `id="my-error-message"`, then the input should have `aria-describedby="my-error-message"`.
