@## Description

**Badge** is a component for visual indicating the product or showing feature status.

_For example, you added a new tab to the report. In this case, you need to highlight a new feature in your product with a `new` badge._

- You can't delete or add a badge, because it is added by the service according to the rules described above.
- Badges are not clickable.
- Badges cannot be used for filtering.

@## Appearance

This component has one size.

### Colors

We use the following badges in the products depending on the status of the product or feature:

| Badge                      | Color          | When used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![admin](static/admin.png) | `--blue-300`   | We use it with products or features that are only available for users with admin rights, i.e. for Semrush employees. We need our colleagues to understand that this functionality is not visible to users.                                                                         |
| ![alpha](static/alpha.png) | `--red-300`    | It is used with products or features that are available only to admins and a limited number of users who have been granted access as beta users. This functionality may be used without any guarantees, it is unstable, and may be changed significantly over time or be disabled. |
| ![beta](static/beta.png)   | `--orange-300` | Used if the following is relevant. Unstable operation of a product/feature. A product/feature was released to test the product hypothesis, and it can have major changes in the future.                                                                                            |
| ![new](static/new.png)     | `--green-300`  | Used with products and features that are out of beta, and with new features that are available to all users. Use it to attract attention to a new product or feature.                                                                                                              |
| ![soon](static/soon.png)   | `--gray-300`   | It can be set on “placeholders” for collecting feedback, simulating the appearance of a new functionality.                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Usage on dark/colored background

Every badge can be inverted like this:

![inverted](static/inverted.png)

Use `--white` color for the background and `--gray-800` for the text color.

@## Feature status

The feature status can be shown inside most of the controls.

### Button

![primary button](static/button_primary.png)
![secondary button](static/button_secondary.png)

### Pill

![pills group](static/pills.png)

### Mention of the feature status in the notification

![notice](static/notice.png)

> Keep in mind that you need to label data in tables using the [Tag](/components/tag/) component, and not using badge which indicates the status of products and features.

@## Location

Badge is usually located to the right outside of the element and to the right inside the element. As an exception, in the [Notice](/components/notice/) component, badge is positioned to the left relative to the text. Badge's margins are always multiples of 4.
