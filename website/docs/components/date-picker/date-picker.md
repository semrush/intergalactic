@## Description

**Date picker** is a component used to input or select a specific date or date range. It is available in four types:

- Date picker (for selecting a single day)
- Date range picker (for selecting a range of days/weeks)
- Month picker (for selecting a single month)
- Month range picker (for selecting a range of months)

@## Trigger

Trigger is built on the [Input](/components/input/) component.

> Use the **en dash** to indicate range of dates. Don’t add a space on either side of the **en dash**.
<!-- > _For example: "Mar 4–10, 2022"._ -->

@## "Apply" button

"Apply" button allows users to submit their selected date(s). The selected date can be submitted by clicking on the date itself or by clicking the "Apply" button (if available).

"Apply" button is typically added to dropdowns when users need to select a range of dates or when selecting a date affects interface limitations. If necessary, the "Apply" button can be added to any type of date picker.

@## Date picker

Date picker selects a single day. Once the day is selected, the dropdown closes and the date in the trigger updates.

> If date has `disabled` state, then nothing should happen after user clicks it.

@## Date picker and "Today" button

You can include a "Today" button that selects the current date. Upon clicking the button, the present date is selected, and the calendar automatically scrolls up to the current month (if it wasn't already displayed).

@## Month picker

selects only one month. Once the month is selected, the dropdown closes, and the value in the trigger updates.

While a calendar with two month blocks can be displayed, it is more commonly used for range selection (see below).

@## Date range picker

Date range picker typically displays two month blocks in the calendar by default. To update the value in the trigger, user must click the "Apply" button after selecting the desired date range.

You can add presets for date ranges. Presets and their names may be customized. The selected preset gets `active` status.

You also can add the "Reset" button for deselecting the selected values. In this case the trigger changes its value to the placeholder.
