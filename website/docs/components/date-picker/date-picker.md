@## "Apply" button

Selected date can be submitted:

- after clicking the date
- or after clicking the "Apply" button (if there is one).

"Apply" button is usually added to the dropdown when user needs to select the range of dates or if the choice of the date affects some limitations in the interface. So you can add it to every type of date picker if needed.

@## Date picker

Date picker selects only one day. After selecting the day the dropdown closes and the date in the trigger updates.

> If date has `disabled` state, then nothing should happen after user clicks it.

@## Date picker + "Today" button

You can add "Today" button that selects the present date. After clicking the button the present date is selected and the calendar is scrolled up to the current month, if another one was selected.
