@## Interaction

> If the user closes the form and then opens it again, the content previously entered into the inputs should be saved.

### Inputs behavior

#### Feedback textarea

- After opening the form set the focus on the textarea.
- **There is a limitation for a minimum of 10 symbols and not less than 3 words in this textarea for submitting it.** If the entered message doesn't match these rules, after submitting it user gets an error with the tooltip describing how many symbols/words are required for submitting feedback.
- User cannot expand this textarea manually (use `noresize`). But if the user entered more than 4 lines, the textarea grows in height itself according to the number of the lines entered. **After 8 lines the textarea doesn't grow in height, scroll appears.**

Label for this textarea: "Tell us your suggestion or report an issue".

#### Checkbox (optional element)

If the user checked the checkbox "I need help...", the message is automatically sent not only to the product team, but also to the Customer Success team, in order they could help the user.

Placeholder for this textarea: "I need help, please contact me".

#### Mailto link (optional element)

You may add a message about the alternative way to send feedback with the `mailto` link: "You can also send us an email at comand_name@semrush.com".

### Buttons behavior

- The trigger of the dropdown should be in the `active` state if the dropdown is opened.
- After validation of the inputs and sending of the message show the success illustration and the text "Thank you for your feedback!". After `2500ms` the dropdown is smoothly closed with a fade of `500ms`.
- After clicking the `Cancel` button the dropdown is closed.
