![feature-popover scheme](static/spotlight-scheme.png)

### Title

The title should be brief, contain a call to action, and summarize the thought of the paragraph. _Example: Save filters._

### Description

The text should not be wrapped around anything, it should always be separated. A paragraph may contain [links](/components/link/) and formatted text.

### Illustration

Illustration depends on the FeaturePopover type (see below). Stylistics of illustrations for advertising notices and blank states is used.

The illustration should help the user to understand the basic idea of the function being advertised. An illustration can be animated if it makes it easier to understand it.

### Closing icon

Closing icon is placed strictly in the upper right corner of the notification. It must close FeaturePopover forever.

> If you need to use FeaturePopover without a crisscross, please discuss it with the UX and UI team.

### Buttons

Two buttons are always placed under the text of the message.

- By clicking the `Got it` button FeaturePopover is closed forever.
- By clicking the `Remind me later` button FeaturePopover is closed until the next user session.

> If you want to use FeaturePopover without one of the buttons or without them at all, please discuss it with the UX/UI team.

### Container

The style of the container is unified in order to keep it recognizable.

### Highlighting dot

The animated dot is placed next to the control that you want to draw attention to. Try to avoid situations where the control has both [Dot](/components/dot/) and FeaturePopover. Otherwise, you will have visual mess, namely two dots on the component😎

@## Types

There are two types of the FeaturePopover: basic and extended. **They differ in maximum width and illustration.**

| Type                                                                                                                                    | Appearance                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Basic**. The illustration is the same for all FeaturePopovers of this type. The area to be illustrated is 40 \* 40px.                 | ![feature-popover](static/spotlight-default.png) |
| **Extended**. The additional Illustration captures the essence of the message metaphorically. The area to be illustrated is 80 \* 80px. | ![feature-popover](static/spotlight-big.png)     |

@## Appearance and hiding

The element appears according to the timings you prescribe. It is hidden only by clicking on the buttons or the closing icon, or by clicking on the highlighted interface element.

@## Usage in UX/UI

> Important! Before using FeaturePopover ask yourself whether your new feature is so good that you want to focus on it. 😏

### General recommendations

- Use FeaturePopover only to display promotional or training information. **The purpose of FeaturePopover is to emphasize a function and/or explain why the user needs it, as well as to give reasons to use it.**
- Remember the user path and the context, in which he will see FeaturePopover. Show FeaturePopover ad hoc and do not overload the message with unnecessary information.
- Always allow the user to close FeaturePopover. Do not force the user to use a feature if he does not need it now.
- Write briefly and concisely. The information in FeaturePopover should not exceed the minimum required to start using the function. Move additional step-by-step instructions to `Info` icons, fake links and so on. Yes, your new feature is very cool, but keep your temper in check. 😏
- Make sure that FeaturePopover does not cover important information that the user needs in the context of use.

### Terms of use

- Do not show more than one FeaturePopover on a page at the same time.
- **FeaturePopover for a new function should be shown for not more than a month.**
- FeaturePopover should be shown in context, for example, when the user interacts with elements in a certain part of the page, or when the next step in the flow should be the illuminated element. If the user interacts with filters, there is no need to show FeaturePopover on the element in the table. Do not distract the user!
- **Do not show FeaturePopover if the user has already interacted with the advertised item.**
- FeaturePopover should be shown only once (exception for cases where user clicked **Show later**). If the user has closed FeaturePopover or clicked **Got it**, do not show this message to him again

@## Recommendations for texts

### The title

- Describe the main value of a function for the user in the title. **Save filters to get data** instead of **Saved filters**. Work together instead of Collaboration.
- Write briefly (2-3 words). If necessary, you can increase the length to five words. Always use a verb.
- Avoid repeating the control label or the text of the element, to which FeaturePopover points.
- Also, avoid repeating the text of the paragraph. This is the title, it should not be pointless 😏

### Message

- Describe a feature or a tip with one or two sentences.
- Tell not only about the function itself, but also about how to use it and why the user needs it.

@## FeaturePopover as part of onboarding.

> **Important!** Show onboarding only to new users who have never seen it. If the user has already seen onboarding once, IT IS NOT NECESSARY to show it again.
>
> _It is important to provide a Help/Product Tour (another name?) link on the report, by clicking on which you can view it again._
