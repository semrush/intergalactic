| `Wizard`          | `aria-labelledby="IDREF"`             | Defines an accessible name for the dialog. Automatically populated from the title in the `Wizard.Sidebar`. |

| `Modal.Close`     | `aria-label="Close"`                  | Defines an accessible name for the **Close** button. Inherited from [Modal](../modal/modal-a11y). |
| <nobr>`Wizard.Sidebar > div`</nobr> | `role="tablist"`    | Identifies the element as a set of tabs. |
|                   | `aria-orientation="vertical"`  | Indicates that the orientation of the tablist is vertical, helping to use the appropriate keys for navigation. |
| `Wizard.Stepper`  | `role="tab"`                          | Identifies the element as a tab. |
|                   | `aria-selected="true/false"`          | Indicates whether the tab is active. |

## Considerations for developers

Ensure the proper heading hierarchy in the `Wizard`. The `Wizard` starts with an `h2` heading by default, so each step should start with an `h3` heading, and so on. Refer to the [example](./wizard-code#basic-example) for details.

## Resources

- [W3 modal dialog example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html) has detailed information about the modal window accessible behavior.
- [A11y style guide](https://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/section-forms.html) describes accessible behavior of all form elements.
