The Wizard component inherits from the [Modal](/components/modal/modal-api) component, so you can use all of its properties.

## Basic example

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx" src="examples/basic_example.tsx"></script>

:::

## Custom step

As the Wizard is typically a complex component, you have the flexibility to use your own components for the steps or pass a function inside to have more control.
