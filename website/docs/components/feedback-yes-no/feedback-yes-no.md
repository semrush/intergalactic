@## Description

**Feedback collection [notice](/components/notice/)** describes the feature and containing a simple question on its work. _For example, “Meet our new Dashboard! Is it working well for you?”._

@## Component appearing

### Two variants are possible for the notice appearing

1. The notice is shown simultaneously with the product or report loading.
2. The notice is shown for the first time in the second session (recommended). Further it is shown until closing or clicking the `Ask me later` button.

> 💡 The session concept is determined by the PO or UX of the product. It may be a time interval, the next loading of the page or an update of the company data.

@## Location

This component is always located near the top border of the report or product.

Upon that, if there is the global search line, place the notice under it.

- Height of the notice — 72px.
- In front of the text place the [image](static/feedback.svg). The image size is 40px х 40px.
- The button `Ask me later` is a `button` with `use="tertiary"`and `theme="info"`. Not a link.
- Optionally you may add a cross icon for closing the plate — `CloseAlt` icon, S size, `$mist` color. Upon hover the cross icon changes its color into `$wall`.

@## Form behavior

See the detailed description of behavior of the feedback dropdown in [Feedback](/components/feedback/).

@## Buttons behavior

### "Yes" and "No" buttons

- the pressed button becomes `active`;
- the dropdown with the feedback form drops down from the pressed button during `500ms`;
- focus is at the textarea. Placeholder says: `Please tell us your suggestion or report an issue`.

### "Send feedback" button

- the button from which the dropdown drops for sending a message is still `active`;
- after validation of the fields and sending of the message we show the illustration and the text `Thank you for your feedback!` in the dropdown;
- after `2500ms` the dropdown is smoothly closed with a fade of `500ms`; after `500ms` more the dropdown with buttons is also closed, dragging the whole page content up during `500ms`.

### "Cancel" button

- the pressed button `Yes` or `No` switches to normal status;
- the notice is not hidden.

@## Closing and appearing of the notice

### "Ask me later" button

1. It is always in the notice, after the `Yes` и `No` buttons.
2. By clicking this button the notice will close;
3. During `500ms` the product/report content is dragged up;
4. The notice appears in the next user session.

### Close icon

> 💡 It's an optional element.

Show this element if the report or product has an alternative form for sending feedback (`Send Feedback` link next to the settings).

- The first variant: it is always in the notice.
- The second variant (**recommended**): when you click on `Ask me later`, the Close icon appears upon opening in the second session (may appear in the second or the third or the n-session).

1. We use the M sized `Close` icon and. `--blue-400` color. While hovering it changes its color to `--blue-500`.
2. After clicking the icon the notice will close.

@## Remembering states

1. If the user sent the feedback, **the notice is not shown to him/her anymore**.
2. It's recommended to store this status in `user`. In order not to be obtrusive.
3. It's allowed to store the statuses of closing and showing in `local storage`.
