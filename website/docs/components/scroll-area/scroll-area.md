@## Interaction

### Behavior

The scroll inside the block can be controlled by means of:

- mouse wheel;
- the arrow key while focusing on an element;
- touchpad gestures, etc.;
- elements of a scrollbar like sliders and buttons.

@## Long scrolling

> _Long scrolling helps to build a narration and sends the user on a journey. It allows the user to scroll through the content without additional interaction._

@## Infinite scrolling

With infinite scrolling content is loaded in portions. This type of scrolling is especially good if there is a lot of content on the page, and you do not need to divide it into separate pages.
