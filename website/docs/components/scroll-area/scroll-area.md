| Element                 | Styles                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `ScrollArea.Bar`        | `background: transparent;`       |
| `ScrollArea.Bar.Slider` | `background: rgba(0, 0, 0, .3);` |

@## Interaction

The scroll inside the block can be controlled by:

- mouse wheel;
- the arrow key while focusing on an element;
- touchpad gestures;
- elements of a scrollbar like sliders and buttons.

<!-- @## Infinite scrolling

With infinite scrolling content is loaded in portions. This type of scrolling is especially good if there is a lot of content on the page, and you do not need to divide it into separate pages.
