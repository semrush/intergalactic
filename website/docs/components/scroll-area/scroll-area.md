### Styles

Scrollbar has the following styles:

| Element                 | Styles                            |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `ScrollArea.Bar`        | `background: transparent;`        |
| `ScrollArea.Bar.Slider` | `background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);` |

Width of the vertical `ScrollArea.Bar` is 8px.

Height of the horizontal `ScrollArea.Bar` is 12px.

> ðŸ’¡ Different width and height of scrollbars for different orientation are made because the user is more likely to interact with a horizontal scrollbar with the mouse, because he needs to hold it to scroll the content. Therefore, it is larger in height.
>
> The mouse wheel easily controls the vertical scroll, so users do not have to point and grasp it. In addition, vertical scroll saves useful width for lists and widgets ðŸ˜Š

@## Interaction

### Behavior

The scroll inside the block can be controlled by means of:

- mouse wheel;
- the arrow key while focusing on an element;
- touchpad gestures, etc.;
- elements of a scrollbar like sliders and buttons.

@## Long scrolling

> _Long scrolling helps to build a narration and sends the user on a journey. It allows the user to scroll through the content without additional interaction._

@## Infinite scrolling

With infinite scrolling content is loaded in portions. This type of scrolling is especially good if there is a lot of content on the page, and you do not need to divide it into separate pages.
