## What component has

### Keyboard support

Table: Keyboard support

| Key           | Function                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab` | Moves focus to the next focusable element.     |
| `Shift + Tab` | Moves focus to the previous focusable element. |
| `Enter` | Submits the entered value.                     |

See detailed information about the keyboard support for the input fields in the [Keyboard control guide](/core-principles/a11y/a11y-keyboard#input_i_textarea).

## Considerations for developers

- Use labels for every input and make the `for=""` and `id=""` values match. IDs must be unique on each page, only one label can be associated to each unique form element. Keep it simple – do not all browsers correctly expose multiple labels that are linked to the same form element.
- Make optional fields obvious by adding text "optional" to the input.
- Inputs with the `invalid` state should be associated with their error message using `aria-describedby`.

## Considerations for designers

* Provide visible text instructions for inputs with constraints, such as a specific format for data.
* Focus must be visible.
* Don’t hide the input label on focus.

## Resources

* [A11y style guide](https://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/section-forms.html#kssref-forms-text-fields) describes core principles for the accessible inputs and textarea.
* [Forms tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/) from W3C helps you understand common methods for creating accessible forms.
* Find live examples of accessible inputs with different types in [DigitalA11y project](https://www.digitala11y.com/demos/accessibility-of-html-input-types-examples/).
