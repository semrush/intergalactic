@## What component has

### Keyboard support

| Key                              | Function                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`                            | Moves focus to the next focusable element.     |
| `Shift + Tab`                    | Moves focus to the previous focusable element. |
| `Up` arrow or `Shift` + `Up`     | Increases the value.                           |
| `Down` arrow or `Shift` + `Down` | Decreases the value.                           |
| `Enter`                          | Submits the entered value.                     |

See detailed information about the keyboard support for the input fileds in the [Keyboard control guide](/core-principles/a11y/a11y-keyboard/#input_i_textarea).

### Roles & attributes

"The implicit role for the `<input type="number">` element is `spinbutton`. If `spinbutton` is not an important feature for your form control, consider not using type="number". Instead, use `inputmode="numeric"` along with a pattern attribute that limits the characters to numbers and associated characters. With `<input type="number">`, there is a risk of users accidentally incrementing a number when they're trying to do something else. Additionally, if users try to enter something that's not a number, there's no explicit feedback about what they're doing wrong."

InputNumber also has the same accessibility recommendations as [Input](/components/input/input-a11y/) has.

@## Considerations for designers

- Focus must be visible.
- Donâ€™t hide the input label on focus.
