@## What component has

Note that the Pills component can function as either a group of radio buttons or a group of tabs, depending on the use case. To select the desired behavior, use the `behavior` property (refer to the [example](/components/pills/pills-code#behavior_arrows)).

### Keyboard support

With `behavior='radio'` (default):

@table-caption Keyboard support

| Key                         | Function                                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Left Arrow`, `Right Arrow` | Set checked value the next/previous button in the group.  |

With `behavior='tabs'`:

@table-caption Keyboard support

| Key                    | Function                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`                  | Moves focus to the next focusable element.                                                                                                                     |
| `Shift + Tab`          | Moves focus to the previous focusable element.                                                                                                                 |
| `Space`, `Enter`       | Change pill's state to active.                                                                                                                                 |
| `Left Arrow`, `Right Arrow` | Moves focus to and checks the next/previous button in the group. If focus is on the last/first button, moves focus to the first/last button respectively. |

### Roles and attributes

@table-caption Roles and attributes

| Role  | Attribute              | Element | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `radiogroup` |                             | `div`   | Identifies the `div` element as a container for a group of `radio` buttons. Isnâ€™t focusable because focus is managed using a roving tabindex strategy as described below.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `radio` |                        | `div`   | Identifies the `div` element as an ARIA `radio` button. The accessible name is computed from the child text content of the `div` element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `tablist`  |                           | `div`    | Indicates that the element serves as a container for a set of tabs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `tab`      |                           | `button` | Indicates the element serves as a `tab` control.|
|       | `tabindex="0"`         | `div`   | Makes the radio button focusable and includes it in the page `Tab` sequence. Set on only one radio in the radio group. On page load, is set on the first radio button in the radio group. Moves with focus inside the radio group so the most recently focused radio button is included in the page `Tab` sequence. This approach to managing focus is described in the section on [roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#kbd_roving_tabindex). |
|            | `tabindex="-1"`             | `div`   | Makes the element focusable but not part of the page `Tab` sequence. Applied to all radio buttons contained in the radio group except for one that is included in the page `Tab` sequence. This approach to managing focus is described in the section on [Roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#keyboardnavigationinsidecomponents). |
|       | `aria-checked="true"`  | `div`   | Identifies `radio` buttons which is checked. CSS attribute selectors (for example `[aria-checked="true"]`) are used to synchronize the visual states with the value of the `aria-checked` attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|       | `aria-checked="false"` | `div`   | Identifies `radio` buttons which are not checked. CSS attribute selectors (for example `[aria-checked="false"]`) are used to synchronize the visual states with the value of the `aria-checked` attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

@## Considerations for developers

- The `<fieldset>` surrounds the entire grouping of checkboxes or radio buttons. The `<legend>` provides a description for the grouping.
- Some assistive technology reads the legend text for each fieldset, so it should be brief and descriptive. This helps someone using assistive technology to understand the question they are answering with the group of radio buttons.

### Roles & attributes

The list below will help you to keep in mind the necessary roles and attributes to make our components fully accessible in your interfaces.
