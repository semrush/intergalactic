## What component has

### Keyboard support

Table: Keyboard support

| Key           | Function                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`         | Moves focus to the next focusable element.     |
| `Shift + Tab` | Moves focus to the previous focusable element. |
| `Esc`         | Closes the modal. Refer to [Closing the modal](./modal.md#closing-the-modal) for more details. |

See more about the focus behavior in the modal in the [Keyboard control guide](/core-principles/a11y/a11y-keyboard#keyboard-support-for-modal-window).

### Roles & attributes

The list below describes roles and attributes that component already has.

Table: Roles & attributes

| Component          | Attribute                  | Usage                                                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Modal.Window`     | `role="dialog"`            | Identifies the element as a dialog, indicating to assistive technology that its content is grouped and separated from the rest of the page content. |
| `Modal.Window`     | `aria-labelledby="IDREF"`  | Gives the dialog an accessible name by referring to the content of `Modal.Title`. |
| `Modal.Window`     | `aria-modal="true"`        | Tells assistive technologies that the content underneath the current dialog isn't available for interaction. |
| `Modal.Close`      | `aria-label="Close"`       | Provides an accessible name for the **Close** button. |

## Considerations for designers & developers

### Attributes

The list below will help you to keep in mind the necessary attributes to make our components fully accessible in the particular cases in your interfaces.

Table: Attributes

| Attribute         | Element | Usage                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aria-describedby="IDREF"`      | `div`   | Gives the dialog an accessible description by referring to the dialog content that describes the primary message or purpose of the dialog. |

### Headings

By default, `Modal.Title` in our Modal component is marked as `h2`. Since there is no strict WCAG recommendation on this, we've made this decision for the following reason: Modal windows are usually part of the page and don't have a separate URL, so to keep consistency within the page, it's recommended to have only one `h1` tag on the page. Having more than one `h1` tag per page can confuse users of assistive technology.

However, if your modal window has a separate URL, you can mark `Modal.Title` as `h1`.
