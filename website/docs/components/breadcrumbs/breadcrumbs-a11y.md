Table: Roles and attributes

| Attribute                  | Element | Usage                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                            | `nav`   | The `nav` element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. |
| `aria-label="Breadcrumbs"` | `nav`   | Provides a label for the group of links that describes the type of navigation provided.                                                                  |
| `aria-current="page"`      | `a`     | Applied to the last link in the set to indicate that it represents the current page.                                                                     |

## Considerations for designers & developers

Don't forget to check that long text in links is truncated with an `ellipsis`, and the full text is displayed in a tooltip when there isn't enough space.
