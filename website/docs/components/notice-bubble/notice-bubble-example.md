Please note that each example uses its own instance of `NoticeBubbleManager`, which can lead to the overlaying of notices from different examples.

@## Basic notice

@example simple

@## NoticeBubble not in portal

If NoticeBubbleContainer has `disablePortal` it will add `position: sticky` to `Bubbles`.

Parent should have `position: relative` and `overflow` with scroll.

@example not-in-portal

@## Undo action

@example action-button

@## Reload action

@example action-button-with-icon

@## Loading state

@example spin-centered

@## Completion state

@example success-centered

@## Success notice

@example success

@## Failure notice

@example failure

@## Dynamic notice (for success/failure states)

@## Special events notice

@## No connection notice

Use `type="warning"` for this case.
