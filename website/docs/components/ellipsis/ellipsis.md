@## Description

**Ellipsis** is a component that truncates a single line of text or paragraph with an ellipsis (…).

**Use this component in the following situations:**

- You need to keep the text from wrapping to a new line.
- You need to truncate the text at a certain line.
- The text is user-entered or dynamic and it's difficult to know how much space to allocate, for example, for [InlineInput](/components/inline-input) width.

**Avoid the following:**

- Truncating an error or validation message, or other notifications.
- Hiding content when there is enough space for it.
- Using the ellipsis component as a punctuation mark at the end of a sentence.

@## Appearance

To include an ellipsis, use `…` (HTML symbol `&hellip;`).

**Shortcuts:**

- OS X: `Opt + ;`
- Win: `alt + 0133`

@## Types

Ellipsis has two types of text truncation:

| Type     | Appearance example                                                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `End`    | ![ellipsis at the end](static/ellipsis-end.png) ![ellipsis at the end with tooltip](static/ellipsis-end-tooltp.png)      | Truncates the end of the text string. It's the most common case. Use an ellipsis at the end of a text string or paragraph to indicate that there is more content, or to shorten a long text string.                                                                   |
| `Middle` | ![ellipsis at the middle](static/ellipsis-middle.png) ![ellipsis at the middle with tooltip](static/ellipsis-middle.png) | Truncates the middle of the text string. Use when several text strings have different beginnings and/or endings but the exact same middle characters. Can also be used to shorten a phrase or text string when the end of a string can't be truncated by an ellipsis. |

@## Tooltip

Add a tooltip on hover to truncated items to show the entire text string, or phrase, unless you're truncating the end of a paragraph.

@## Use in UX/UI

### Long URL links

Usually, long URL links are most common for tables and other widgets. Read the detailed information about long URL links in [Table](table-group//table-controls/#long_links_and_text).

### Table Head

To show more data in the limited space you can truncate the text in the table head. In this case always show a tooltip on hover to show the entire text string, or phrase.

### Breadcrumbs

When you need to truncate links in Breadcrumbs, collapse them into ellipsis at the end of each string.

### Card titles

To show more data in a limited space you can truncate the [Card](/components/card) title. In this case always show a tooltip on hover to show the entire title.

### Paragraphs

To show more data in a limited space you can truncate paragraphs at the end. In this case, a tooltip with the full paragraph on hover is unnecessary.
