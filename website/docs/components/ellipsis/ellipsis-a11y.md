## Considerations for developers

- Ensure that the complete text string is communicated to a screen reader and not just the truncated visual part. Currently, when navigating the page with a screen reader such as JAWS, this is the observed behavior.
- Offer a trigger for keyboard users to access the tooltip of a truncated text string. If a user is navigating the page with a keyboard instead of a screen reader, they may not be aware of the contents of the full text string.
