title: Chrome extension
---

We have [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-kit-highlighting/capgemjgihoboclcfdblhbdokpldhemf/) that highlights components in the products according to the ui-kit version.

> Note that chrome extension is available only for the users registered in the corporate mail.

Our extension can collect data about components from all our libraries used in the Semrush products. We need this data for the development of our design system.

We would be very grateful if you install/update the extension and help us collect data (it collects data even when if it's turned off but only if you are using VPN/internal network).

**Here are few steps to install the extension:**

1. Open the [link with extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-kit-highlighting/capgemjgihoboclcfdblhbdokpldhemf/)
2. Press **Add to Chrome**
3. You can turn it on/off to check your interface

**And few steps to update the extension if you already have it:**

1. Go to extension settings
2. Turn on Developers mode
3. Press Update and check that your version is 0.3.0

That't all! You are awesome ❤️
