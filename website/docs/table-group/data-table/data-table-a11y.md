## Considerations for developers

* When your tables get complex, use the `<th>` element to identify the header cells by adding a scope attribute. For header rows use `<th scope="row">`. For header columns use `<th scope="col"`>
* Add the optional `<caption>` element before the table content to give users more information on the table contents. Think of it as a headline for your table. Note that the `caption` element must be the first child of the `table` element.

Refer to [A11y style guide](https://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/section-structure.html#kssref-structure-tables) for the examples.

## Considerations for designers

If you need to show different states of the table rows or cells, please donâ€™t rely solely on color to convey information. Add some non-color visual indicator of the state, such as text or an icon with appropriate alternative text into the cells.
