@## Basic rules for table states

> ðŸ’¡ The block with the text of the states inside the table must get the `sticky` property when scrolling and be centered relative to the parent block and the user's viewport.
>
> Thus the user will always see what is happening with the table, and won't need to scroll to the top of the table.

A block with a loading state or error state must have `margin-top: 40px`, so that when the user changes the size of the viewport, the block with the error does not "stick" to other blocks.

|                          | First screen                                              | The state of the page scrolling                           |

| Example with Spin        | ![table with sticky spinner](static/sticky-loading-1.png) | ![table with sticky spinner](static/sticky-loading-2.png) |

> ðŸ’¡ It is also not recommended to change the table height when changing states.

@## Skeleton

When loading data for the first time, show the structure of the loaded page and data. Use the [Skeleton](/components/skeleton/).

**When showing:**

- page loading;
- initial data loading;
- uploading new data.

We recommend using the skeleton to show only the first three rows, not the entire table.

> ðŸ’¡ We don't show pagination when loading the table for the first time, because we don't know how much data we will show in the end.

![table with skeleton](static/skeleton.png)

In a secondary table, you can use the skeleton for all the rows (there are usually no more than 5-10 rows).

![table with skeleton](static/skeleton-secondary.png)

@## Progressbar

If gathering data takes a large period of time (more than 1 minute, for example), we show that data is being collected. Use the [ProgressBar](/components/progress-bar) in this case.

**We show it in cases when data is collected for a very long time (more than 1 minute).** Showing the progressbar. A block with a progress bar and text gets `sticky` property and is centered relative to the block that the user scrolls.

![table with sticky progressbar](static/sticky-1.png)

When scrolling the table, pin the progressbar to the table header. The state description is centered relative to the user's viewport.

![table with sticky progressbar](static/sticky-2.png)

@## Loading

This state is for cases when we filter/sort/search data. In this case, we use [Spin](/components/spin/).

If data loading is fast, then this state is not necessary.

**When showing:**

- filtering vast data volumes in a table;
- sorting a large amount of data in a table;
- go to another page;
- other data operations that do not require a long wait;
- search in the table (if possible, show the search query).

The block with the spinner gets the `sticky` property and is centered relative to the block that the user scrolls.

@## Empty table

The table is empty and has no data in it, because the data was either deleted or was not provided at the beginning of working with the table.

**When showing:**

- the table is empty and, for example, you need to connect data to it;
- the user deleted all data from the table.

> ðŸ’¡ The illustrations for these cases are usually unique. Designers create them for each specific case or tool if needed.

@## No data

**When showing:**

- We don't have data for some reason.
- For some reason, we can't show the data.

> ðŸ’¡ The icon for this state can be found in the [library for empty states](https://static.semrush.com/ui-kit/widget-empty/1.4.0/table.svg). All other icons and their names can be found in the [documentation of empty states](/components/widget-empty/widget-empty-code/).

@## Nothing found

When searching or applying a filter in the table, we didn't find anything.

> ðŸ’¡ In this state, save the active state of the sorted column.

**Showing this state when there is no have data** on the parameters requested by the user. The user performed some actions with filters or sorting of data.

In this state, we recommend adding a control that will help the user correct the situation. For example, you can add a `Clear filters` button.

@## Something went wrong

There was an error in the tool on the backend, so we can't show the data. For more information about such errors, see [Errors, n/a, nothing found in the widgets](/components/widget-empty/).

**When showing:**

- The error at the stage of table loading

- Error while working with the table

| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| We are aware of the problem, and report it | ![table with known error](static/error-known.png)         |
| We don't know about the problem            | ![table with not known error](static/error-not-known.png) |

@## Message text

It is important to indicate the following things in the empty state message:

- In the heading â€“ the essence of the current situation.
- In the description â€“ what you need to do to change the state.
- If possible, suggest an action (in the form of a button or link).
  For more information about the rules for such States, see the guides â€“ [Errors, n/a, nothing found in widgets](/components/widget-empty/), [Global errors](/patterns/global-errors/), etc.

@## Table header

For all empty states of the table, we keep the header. If it has sorting icons, we also keep them.

@## Cell empty & error states

### There is no data in the cell

- Show the `n/a` text in the secondary text color `var(--gray60)`.
- It is recommended to show a tooltip with an explanation that the data is not available (and for what reason).

![table cell with n/a](static/cell-na.png)

### Data uploading in the cell

> ðŸ’¡ Note that we use [Skeleton](/components/skeleton/). when loading the table for the first time.

When loading content in one or more cells, we show the [Spin](/components/spin/) of S size.

![table cell with spin](static/cell-loading.png)

### Error in a table cell

This is the state when something broke in a particular cell and we can't show the data.

- We use the `WarningXS` icon in a warning orange color.
- On the hover, we always show a tooltip with an explanation that something went wrong.

> ðŸ’¡ We recommend giving the user the opportunity to change the situation so that the data appears. In this case, you can display the control in a cell for reloading data, and so on.

![table cell with warning](static/cell-danger.png)

### The cell is blocked

A cell in a table may be blocked by a limit or by the need to take some action to unlock the data.

- Use the `LockXS` icon in the color `var(--stone)`.
- On the hover, we always show a tooltip with an explanation of why the cell is blocked and, if possible, how to get rid of this state.
