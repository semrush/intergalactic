@## Empty table

All the basic states of our [table](/table-group/table/) âœ¨ are gathered here.

> ðŸ’¡ The block with the text of the states inside the table must get the `sticky` property when scrolling and be centered relative to the parent block and the user's viewport.
>
> Thus the user will always see what is happening with the table, and won't need to scroll to the top of the table.

A block with a loading state or error state must have `margin-top: 40px`, so that when the user changes the size of the viewport, the block with the error does not "stick" to other blocks.

| Example with Progressbar | ![table with sticky progressbar](static/sticky-1.png)     | ![table with sticky progressbar](static/sticky-2.png)     |
| Example with Spin        | ![table with sticky spinner](static/sticky-loading-1.png) | ![table with sticky spinner](static/sticky-loading-2.png) |

> ðŸ’¡ It is also not recommended to change the table height when changing states.

@## Loading

When loading data for the first time, show the structure of the loaded page and data. Use the [Skeleton](/components/skeleton/).

**When showing:**

- page loading;
- initial data loading;
- uploading new data.

We recommend using the skeleton to show only the first three rows, not the entire table.

> ðŸ’¡ We don't show pagination when loading the table for the first time, because we don't know how much data we will show in the end.

![table with skeleton](static/skeleton.png)

In a secondary table, you can use the skeleton for all the rows (there are usually no more than 5-10 rows).

@## No data

If gathering data takes a large period of time (more than 1 minute, for example), we show that data is being collected. Use the [ProgressBar](/components/progress-bar) in this case.

**We show it in cases when data is collected for a very long time (more than 1 minute).** Showing the progressbar. A block with a progress bar and text gets `sticky` property and is centered relative to the block that the user scrolls.

![table with sticky progressbar](static/sticky-1.png)

When scrolling the table, pin the progressbar to the table header. The state description is centered relative to the user's viewport.

@## Nothing found

This state is for cases when we filter/sort/search data. In this case, we use [Spin](/components/spin/).

If data loading is fast, then this state is not necessary.

**When showing:**

- filtering vast data volumes in a table;
- sorting a large amount of data in a table;
- go to another page;
- other data operations that do not require a long wait;
- search in the table (if possible, show the search query).

The block with the spinner gets the `sticky` property and is centered relative to the block that the user scrolls.

@## Skeleton

The table is empty and has no data in it, because the data was either deleted or was not provided at the beginning of working with the table.

**When showing:**

- the table is empty and, for example, you need to connect data to it;
- the user deleted all data from the table.

> ðŸ’¡ The illustrations for these cases are usually unique. Designers create them for each specific case or tool if needed.

@## Something went wrong

**When showing:**

- We don't have data for some reason.
- For some reason, we can't show the data.
