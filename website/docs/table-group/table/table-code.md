Our library has two components for tables:

- `Table` component is the old one.
- `DataTable` component is completely new and based on `CSS-flex` technology and does not use native tables.

**We recommend you to use `DataTable` component ðŸ˜‰**

@## Examples

- For the old `Table` component see the [Old table code and API](/table-group/table-old/).
- For `DataTable` component see code examples in the [Table code and API](/table-group/data-table/).
