> ðŸš¨ `Table` component is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Please, use [DataTable](/table-group/data-table/) instead.

Our library has two components for tables:

- `Table` component is the old one.
- `DataTable` component is completely new, built with CSS flex and doesn't use native tables.
**We recommend you to use `DataTable` component ðŸ˜‰**

@## Examples

- For the old `Table` component see the [Table (old))](/table-group/table-old/).
- For `DataTable` component see code examples in the [DataTable](/table-group/data-table/data-table-code).
