@## Stacked area

If you need to display a part-to-whole ratio – use the `<StackedArea/>` and `<StackedArea.Area/>` components.

@example stacked-area

@## Edge cases

- If a part of the chart has no data – use a dashed line to draw that period.
- If the data has only one value – display it as a dot.
- Two consecutively known values will automatically be displayed as the `StackedArea` component.

@example stacked-area-without-data
