**Notes** is a module for creating notes and displaying them in charts.

- Notes can be created by the user, system, or other services. You can make an unlimited number of notes for a single date.
- We recommended you to place a trigger for managing notes above the chart.
- _In exceptional cases place it under the chart._

> See the detailed guide in the [inner Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/eqedT6ztHYWNoikkTOmiUV/Notes-%E2%80%A2-List%2C-widget%2C-library?node-id=106%3A51861&viewport=961%2C72%2C0.5). **It's available only for Semrush developers.**
