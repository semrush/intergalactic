Our library has two components for charts:

- Chart component is based on the [recharts library](http://recharts.org). This library is extremely slow evolving.
- D3-chart component is completely new and developed specifically for our needs.

**We recommend you to use D3-chart component ðŸ˜‰**

@## Examples

- See code examples for D3-chart component in the [D3 concept guide](/data-display/d3-chart/).
- For chart component see chart guides and [recharts library](http://recharts.org) documentation. Note that all exports are `recharts` exports.
