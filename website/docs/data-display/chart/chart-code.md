Our library has two components for charts:

- `Chart` component is based on the [recharts library](http://recharts.org). This library is extremely slow evolving.
- `D3-chart` component is completely new and developed specifically for our needs.

**We recommend you to use `D3-chart` component ðŸ˜‰**

@## Examples

- For `Chart` component see chart guides and [recharts library](http://recharts.org) documentation. Note that all exports are `recharts` exports.
- For `D3-chart` component see code examples in the [D3 concept guide](/data-display/d3-chart/).
