## Description

These components serve as the base for building charts from your data in the product.

They don't manipulate your data, and will not try to calculate, sort or check it in any way. Data manipulation is the product's job, not the component's.

Charts are a complex component that cannot be applied in a single line. That's why its API may seem a bit inflated, since it supports all the concepts of our design system.

## Concept

- We want to provide you with a convenient way to use the imperative d3 style with React's declarative approach.
- All charts are based on [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale), which you transfer to our charts in a customized form.
- We try to provide access to each SVG node, so you could modify it if needed.

Each element that you place on the chart is based on a real SVG element or a group of elements. For example, when you render `<Line/>`, you will get an SVG (`<line d = {...}>`). All properties you pass to `<Line/>` will go to the native SVG `<line d = {...}>` tag.

When you render `<Line.Dots/>` (dots on a line plot), you get a set of `<circle cx = {...} cy = {...}/>`. So all properties you pass to <Line.Dots/> will also go to the native SVG `<circle cx = {...} cy = {...}/>` tag.

For a point change in the properties of each specific dot, you need to pass a function that will be called at each dot with the calculated properties of this dot:

```jsx
<Line.Dots>
  {(props) => {
    return {
      // ...your_props
    };
  }}
</Line.Dots>
```

::: tip
You also can put functions into single elements if your properties are calculated dynamically.
:::

Since many SVG elements don't support nesting, they are rendered sequentially. For example, this code example doesn't nest `<circle/>` in `<line/>`, but draws them one after another:

```jsx
<Line>
  <Line.Dots />
</Line>
```

CSS is responsible for all the chart styles. See [Themes](/style/design-tokens/design-tokens#themes) for more information on how to customize it.

## Base

Any SVG container must have absolute values for its size.

See [d3-scale docs on GitHub](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) for more information about the types of `scale`, as well as their `range` and `domain`.

::: tip
The `range` of the horizontal `scale` is inverted, so that the axes origin is at the bottom left corner.
:::

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/base.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Paddings & margins

SVG size and chart plot size are usually different to prevent the clipping of additional items such as axes, axis values, and the legend.

That's why values in `scale.range ()` are set with a shift.

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/paddings-&-margins.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Axes

When you pass `scale` to the root component it also sets the coordinate axes. However, you still need to specify them for them to render.

- `XAxis/YAxis` are the axis lines.
- `ticks` are the values on the axis.

It is also possible to have multiple axes with different positions.

You can get the number of ticks from the `scale.ticks` or `scale.domain` method. To calculate an approximate number of ticks, divide the chart size by the size of a one tick.

::: tip
According to the design guide, `YAxis` is hidden by default `(hide = true)`.
:::

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/axes.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Axis values

You can change the values and properties on the axis by passing a function.

The default tag is `<text/>`, but you can change it by defining the `tag` property. For example, you can change it to `foreignObject` for inserting `html` components.

::: tip
The function arguments contain calculated XY coordinates that you can use to shift the object as needed.
:::

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/axis-values.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Additional lines

Additional lines are formed in the same way as ticks.

::: tip
To make things easier, ticks can be specified on the `Axis` component itself, and it will be automatically passed to `<Axis.Ticks/>` and `<Axis.Grid/>`.
:::

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/additional-lines.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Axes titles

Axis titles are formed in the same way as ticks and additional lines.

::: tip
By default, the title is set to the right for the Oy axis, and at the top for the Ox axis. However, you can change this condition by passing the desired location to `position`: `right`, `top`, `left`, or `bottom`.
:::

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
import { Bar, XAxis, Plot, YAxis } from 'intergalactic/d3-chart';
  export Demo from './examples/axes-titles.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Tooltip

You can add a tooltip to the chart, for which you can set `Title` and `Footer`.

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/tooltip.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Adaptive chart

For SVG charts to display correctly on responsive layouts, you need to dynamically calculate their width and height. To help you with that, we created the `ResponsiveContainer` component that supports all the [Box properties](/layout/box-system/box-api) and can help you flexibly adjust the chart size.

::: tip
`ResponsiveContainer` supports the `aspect` property â€“ the aspect ratio between the width and height of a chart.
:::

```jsx
<ResponsiveContainer aspect={1}> // width = height ...</ResponsiveContainer>
```

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/adaptive-chart.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Chart legend

Refer to [Chart legend](/data-display/chart-legend/chart-legend), for a guide on how to implement a clickable chart legend.

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/chart-legend.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Reference line

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/reference-line.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Synchronous charts

You can pass a single `eventEmitter` to synchronize the charts.

::: tip
Be careful when choosing the `scale` for the axis, since it's common across different charts.
:::

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/synchronous-charts.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Tooltip control

To control over tooltip visibility and targeted position, imperatively call plot's event emitter.

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/tooltip-control.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Export to image

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/export-to-image.tsx';
</script>

:::

## Initial data loading

For the initial loading of the charts, use skeleton components that are specified for all complex charts right inside them, or use [Skeleton](/components/skeleton/skeleton) for simple charts. 

Note that, if a chart has a title, it should be displayed while the chart is loading.

## Pattern fill

To enable visual patterns on chart, simply add `pattern` prop to the chart component.

`pattern` prop is inherited by all children components. So, you can apply it both to _end_ components like `Line` and to _container_ components like `Plot` .

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/pattern-fill.tsx';
</script>

### Enforcing patterns

You can enforce use of build-in patterns by using it's names. The list of available patterns:

1. `starSmall`
1. `romb`
1. `circleOutline`
1. `triangleDown`
1. `rombOutline`
1. `square`
1. `trees`
1. `wave`
1. `star`
1. `cogwheel`
1. `crossesDiagonal`
1. `triangleOutline`
1. `chain`
1. `squama`
1. `linesDouble`
1. `zigzagVertical`
1. `triangleDownOutline`
1. `crosses`
1. `linesDoubleHorizontal`
1. `waveVertical`
1. `squareOutline`
1. `triangle`
1. `crescent`
1. `zigzag`

::: sandbox

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/enforcing-patterns.tsx';
</script>

:::

### Custom patterns

You can provide custom pattern object to enforce it's form. The pattern object should include both fill and symbol properties.

The fill data is used for rendering charts like an `Area` while symbol data is needed to render corresponding symbol in chart legend or on the dots.

You can also provide a list of patterns.

### Low level components use

You can access `PatternFill` and `PatternSymbol` components for low level use. 

`PatternFill` allows you to initialize [svg pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Patterns) and use it for customized charts.

`PatternSymbol` allows you to render symbols, you can use pattern key to sync it with `PatternFill` that use same pattern key.

<script lang="tsx">
  export Demo from './examples/low-level-components-use.tsx';
</script>

:::

## A11y formatting

You can provide formatting functions that will control a11y module generated summary and data table content. 

::: tip

Click on this tip (to place focus on it) and press `Tab` to navigate to the chart until you see the a11y module.
