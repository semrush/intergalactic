For this component, follow these recommendations on the accessibility:

- If a text metric is present next to the mini chart, the SVG doesn't require assistive technology reading. Treat the mini chart as a decorative element in this case and leave the `alt` attribute empty: `alt=""`.
- If there's no accompanying text metric, generate a concise `alt` description for the mini chart indicating the information the chart conveys, such as the trend's highest or lowest value, for example.
- If you intend to make the mini chart a clickable element or link, enclose it in the appropriate tags (`a` or `button`). This ensures better touch target control and allows the addition of elements like text within the hover area. For links and buttons, include an `aria-label` unless they contain visible text readable by assistive technology.
