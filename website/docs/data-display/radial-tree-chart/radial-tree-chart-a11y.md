Radial tree chart is accessible for screen readers. Refer to [Accessibility section in D3 chart documentation](/data-display/d3-chart/d3-chart-a11y) to know more. If you are making your radial tree interactive, make sure that chart isn’t the only way to accomplish user scenario. For example, provide `<Select />` to allow user to pick the radians.
