title: Recharts code
---

> ðŸŽ‰ Try out [new chart library](/data-display/area-chart/area-chart-d3-code/) developed entirely with the D3.

@## An example of a simple use

In the data, we specify `size`, which is the size of the circle, and `sets`, which is the intersection of the circles.

@example basic-recharts

@## Setting the orientation

The chart orientation (rotation) and the order of circles can be changed.

@example orientation-and-order-recharts

@## Legend

You can add and remove the legend yourself (we'll add this example later ðŸ¤·).

@## Data loading

@example skeleton-recharts
