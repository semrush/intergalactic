## Description

It's a component for building a 12-column grid.

::: tip
In the product interface we use a 12-column grid with a fixed 24px gutter between columns. The columns stretch.
:::

## Example use

The `Row` component accepts all the properties of the `Flex` component, and the `Col` component accepts all the properties of the `Box` component.

The grid works as desktop first, as our core products are designed to work primarily on the desktop.
