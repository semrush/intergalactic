## Considerations for developers

- Make sure each form control is labeled using `<label>`, `aria-labelledby`, or `aria-label`
- Use `fieldset` and `legend` elements to group and label related form controls
- Validate input provided by the user and provide options to undo changes and confirm data entry
- Use autocomplete attribute for common fields
- When a form with errors is submitted, make sure focus is moved to the first invalid field for inline errors, or to the error container for top-of-form errors

### Keyboard support

Read more about keyboard support for all form elements in the [Keyboard control guide](/core-principles/a11y/a11y-keyboard).

## Considerations for designers

- Provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form and individual form controls.
- Use autocomplete for common fields.
- Notify users about successful task completion, any errors, and provide instructions to help them correct mistakes.
- Divide long forms into multiple smaller forms that constitute a series of logical steps or stages and inform users about their progress.
- Show visible labels for inputs. Placeholder text isnâ€™t a suitable substitute as it disappears when users start typing, which is difficult for those with cognitive disabilities. Also, assistive technology may not recognize it as the field's name. Input labels should always be visible.
- Use appropriate form layout. Check [advantages and disadvantages of the vertical and horizontal form layouts](/patterns/form/form#vertical_form_layout_vs_horizontal_form_layout).
