@## Considerations for developers

- Use the `label` element, and, in specific cases, other mechanisms (e.g. WAI-ARIA, title attribute etc.), to identify each form control.
- Use the `fieldset` and `legend` elements to group and associate related form controls.
- Validate input provided by the user and provide options to undo changes and confirm data entry.

See [Forms Tutorial from W3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/) for the detailed information and links.

### Keyboard support

See detailed information about the keyboard support for the all form elements in the [Keyboard control guide](/core-principles/a11y/a11y-keyboard/).

@## Considerations for designers

- Provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form and individual form controls.
- Notify users about successful task completion, any errors, and provide instructions to help them correct mistakes.
- Divide long forms into multiple smaller forms that constitute a series of logical steps or stages and inform users about their progress.
