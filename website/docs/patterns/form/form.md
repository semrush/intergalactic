@## Description

**Form** is a pattern for collecting and sending data to the system. It always consists of different types of inputs and controls.

> Use one size of inputs and controls in the form.

@## Layout

| Layout type | Example                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Horizontal  | ![](static/horizontal.png)   |
| Vertical    | ![](static/vertical.png)     |
| Inline      | ![](static/inline.png)       |

@## Input labels

Input should have a text label.

- Font weight should be `regular`. In cases when you need an extra accent fo the input's label you can use `bold` font-weight.
- **Don’t put a colon after the text label.**

You also can mark the input as an optional.

| Input size | Vertical layout                                                  | Horizontal layout                                                       | Font size                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| M          | ![](static/input-m.png)       | ![](static/input-left-m.png)       | 14px (Use `--fs-200`, `--lh-200` tokens) |
|            | ![](static/checkbox-m.png) | ![](static/checkbox-left-m.png) |                                          |
|            | ![](static/textarea-m.png) | ![](static/textarea-left-m.png) |                                          |
| L          | ![](static/input-l.png)       | ![](static/input-left-l.png)       | 16px (Use `--fs-300`, `--lh-300` tokens) |
|            | ![](static/checkbox-l.png) | ![](static/checkbox-left-l.png) |                                          |
|            | ![](static/textarea-l.png) | ![](static/textarea-left-l.png) |                                          |

In cases, when the form is centered on the page, input labels can be right-aligned.

@## Placeholders

Placeholders are required to prompt the user about what data should be entered.

- It isn’t user-friendly to use only placeholders for inputs. When completed, such form becomes poorly readable.
- Don’t put a specific value as a placeholder. The user may think that the input has already been filled.

You can omit the placeholder only if the input’s purpose is obvious.

To format values that the user enters use [InputMask](/components/input-mask/).

@## Inputs

> After opening the form the first input should get the `focus`.

**The main denominator in the design system is 4.** All margins between the components and widgets shall be a multiple of this denominator. See [Spacing system](/layout/box-system/#spacing_system) for more information.

| Input size | Example           |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| M          | ![](static/m.png) |
| L          | ![](static/l.png) |

@## Usage in UX/UI

### Vertical form layout vs. horizontal form layout

Depending on your task, you can use vertical or horizontal form layout.

Briefly:

- vertical layout is good for short simple forms and forms for mobile screens;
- horizontal layout is suitable for complex forms, where you need to slow the user down to help them avoid mistakes.

### Vertical form layout

**When to use?**

- The form is small and simple.
- The cost of a mistake after completing the form isn’t big.

**Advantages of vertical form layout**

- It is quicker to be completed (see the [research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php)).
- It is simpler to be scanned with eyes.
- It is ideal for multilingual interfaces.

**Disadvantages of vertical form layout**

- It needs more vertical space.
- It isn’t an ideal solution for large forms (and the complex ones).

### Horizontal form layout, left label alignment

**When to use?**

- The form is large and/or complex, and you need to slow the user down in order they don’t make mistakes.
- “Price of the mistake” after the completion of a large form is significant.

**Advantages of horizontal form layout with left label alignment**

- It can be compact (take less vertical space, unlike the forms with vertical layout).
- It claims more user’s attention.

**Disadvantages of horizontal form layout with left label alignment**

- It needs more horizontal space.
- It takes more time to complete (see the [research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php)).
- It is less suitable for multilingual interfaces.
- Screen magnification users may find it challenging to match labels with inputs as they only see a small part of the screen at a time.

### Horizontal form layout, right label alignment

**When to use?**

- The form is large and/or complex, and you need to slow the user down to help them avoid mistakes.
- Right alignment of labels visually better connects labels with inputs, in comparison with left alignment.

**Advantages of horizontal form layout with right label alignment**

- In view of visual connection between the label and the input this variant is better than the previous one.
- Higher results of filling rate, in comparison with the previous one (see the [research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php)).
- It can be more compact in comparison with the forms with vertical layout.

**Disadvantages of horizontal form layout with right label alignment**

- Such forms are more difficult to be scanned and read (labels are right aligned, user needs more time to find the beginning of the following line).
- It is less suitable for multilingual interfaces.
