## Description

**Form** is a pattern used for the collection and submission of data to the system. It consistently includes various types of inputs and controls.

**Use one size for inputs and controls within the form.**

## Layout types

Table: Form layout types

| Layout type | Example                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Horizontal  | ![](static/horizontal.png)   |
| Vertical    | ![](static/vertical.png)     |
| Inline      | ![](static/inline.png)       |

## Input labels

Input should have accompanying text label.

- The font weight should be set to `regular`. Use `bold` font-weight sparingly for emphasizing input labels.
- Omit the use of a colon after the text label.
  
You also could mark the input as an optional.

| Input size | Vertical layout    | Horizontal layout        | Font size         |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| M          | ![](static/input-m.png)       | ![](static/input-left-m.png)       | 14px (`--fs-200`, `--lh-200` tokens) |
|            | ![](static/checkbox-m.png) | ![](static/checkbox-left-m.png) |                                          |
|            | ![](static/textarea-m.png) | ![](static/textarea-left-m.png) |                                          |
| L          | ![](static/input-l.png)       | ![](static/input-left-l.png)       | 16px (`--fs-300`, `--lh-300` tokens) |
|            | ![](static/checkbox-l.png) | ![](static/checkbox-left-l.png) |                                          |
|            | ![](static/textarea-l.png) | ![](static/textarea-left-l.png) |                                          |

When the form is centered on the page, input labels can be aligned to the right.

## Placeholders

Placeholders are necessary to guide users on the expected data input.

- Relying solely on placeholders for inputs isn't user-friendly, as the completed form can become difficult to read.
- Avoid using specific values as placeholders, as users might think the input is pre-filled.

Placeholders can be omitted when the input's purpose is self-evident.

For formatting user-entered values, use the [InputMask](/components/input-mask/input-mask).

## Margins between inputs

The key unit in the design system is 4. All spacings between components and widgets should be multiples of this unit. Refer to the [Spacing system](/layout/box-system/box-system#spacing_system) for further information.

Table: Margins between inputs

| Input size | Example           |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| M          | ![](static/m.png) |
| L          | ![](static/l.png) |

## Usage in UX/UI

### Vertical form layout vs. horizontal form layout

Depending on your objectives, you can choose between vertical and horizontal form layouts.

In brief:

- Vertical layout is suitable for short and simple forms, especially on mobile screens.
- Horizontal layout is preferable for complex forms, slowing users down to reduce errors.

### Vertical form layout

**When to use**

- The form is small and straightforward.
- Mistakes made after form completion have minimal consequences.

**Advantages of vertical form layout**

- Faster completion (refer to [research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php)).
- Easier scanning with the eyes.
- Ideal for multilingual interfaces.

**Disadvantages of vertical form layout**

- Requires more vertical space.
- Not ideal for extensive or complex forms.

### Horizontal form layout, left label alignment

**When to use**

- The form is sizable and/or complex, warranting a slower user pace to prevent errors.
- Substantial consequences result from mistakes after completing a large form.

**Advantages of horizontal form layout with left label alignment**

- Can be more compact (uses less vertical space than vertical layouts).
- Attracts more user attention.

**Disadvantages of horizontal form layout with left label alignment**

- Requires more horizontal space.
- Takes longer to complete (see [research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php)).
- Less suitable for multilingual interfaces.
- Users who magnify their screens may struggle to match labels with inputs, given their limited screen visibility.

### Horizontal form layout, right label alignment

**When to use**

- The form is sizable and/or complex, requiring a slower user pace to prevent errors.
- Right-aligned labels enhance the visual connection between labels and inputs, compared to left alignment.

**Advantages of horizontal form layout with right label alignment**

- Improved visual connection between labels and inputs.
- Higher completion rates compared to the previous layout (see [research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php)).
- Potentially more compact than vertical layouts.

**Disadvantages of horizontal form layout with right label alignment**

- More challenging to scan and read (labels are right-aligned, requiring more time to find the start of each line).
- Less suitable for multilingual interfaces.
