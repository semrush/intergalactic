@## Description

**Form** is a pattern for collecting and sending data to the system. It always consists of different types of inputs and controls.

> Use one size of inputs and controls in the form.

@## Layout

| Layout type | Example                                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Horizontal  | ![horizontal positioning for input label](static/horizontal.png) |
| Vertical    | ![vertical positioning for input label](static/vertical.png)     |
| Inline      | ![inline input positioning](static/inline.png)                   |

@## Input labels

Input should have a text label.

- Font weight should be `regular`. In cases when you need an extra accent fo the input's label you can use `bold` font-weight.
- **Do not put a colon after the text label.**

In cases when you need to save space and if it is clear from the context what data should be entered into the input, you can use only placeholder for the input.

You also can mark the input as an optional.

| Input size | Vertical layout                                                  | Horizontal layout                                                       | Font size                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| M          | ![vertical label with margin to input](static/input-m.png)       | ![horizontal label with margin to input](static/input-left-m.png)       | 14px (Use `--fs-200`, `--lh-200` tokens) |
|            | ![vertical label with margin to checkbox](static/checkbox-m.png) | ![horizontal label with margin to checkbox](static/checkbox-left-m.png) |                                          |
|            | ![vertical label with margin to textarea](static/textarea-m.png) | ![horizontal label with margin to checkbox](static/textarea-left-m.png) |                                          |
| L          | ![vertical label with margin to input](static/input-l.png)       | ![horizontal label with margin to input](static/input-left-l.png)       | 16px (Use `--fs-300`, `--lh-300` tokens) |
|            | ![vertical label with margin to checkbox](static/checkbox-l.png) | ![horizontal label with margin to checkbox](static/checkbox-left-l.png) |                                          |
|            | ![vertical label with margin to textarea](static/textarea-l.png) | ![horizontal label with margin to checkbox](static/textarea-left-l.png) |                                          |

In cases, when the form is centered on the page, input labels can be right-aligned.

@## Placeholders

Placeholders are required to prompt the user about what data should be entered.

- It is not user-friendly to use only placeholders for inputs. When completed, such form becomes poorly readable.
- Do not put a specific value as a placeholder. The user may think that the input has already been filled.

You may not add a placeholder only if the input’s purpose is obvious.

To format values that the user enters use [InputMask](/components/input-mask/).

@## Inputs

> After opening the form the first input should get the `focus`.

**The main denominator in the design system is 4.** All margins between the components and widgets shall be a multiple of this denominator. See [Spacing system](/layout/box-system/#spacing_system) for more information.

| Input size | Example                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| M          | ![paddings between input in a form](static/m.png) |
| L          | ![paddings between input in a form](static/l.png) |

@## Usage in UX/UI

### Vertical form layout vs. horizontal form layout

Depending on your task, you can use vertical or horizontal form layout.

Briefly:

- vertical layout is good for short simple forms and forms for mobile screens;
- horizontal layout is suitable for complex forms, where you need to slow the user down in order he/she do not make mistakes.

### Vertical form layout

**When to use?**

- The form is small and simple.
- “Price of the mistake” after completing the form is not big.

![labels above inputs example](static/label-1.png)

**Advantages of vertical form layout**

- It is quicker to be completed (see the [research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php)).
- It is simpler to be scanned with eyes.
- It is ideal for multilingual interfaces.

**Disadvantages of vertical form layout**

- It needs more vertical space.
- It is not an ideal solution for large forms (and the complex ones).

### Horizontal form layout, left label alignment

**When to use?**

- The form is large and/or complex, and you need to slow the user down in order he/she do not make mistakes.
- “Price of the mistake” after the completion of a large form is significant.

**Advantages of horizontal form layout with left label alignment**

- It can be compact (take less vertical space, unlike the forms with vertical layout).
- It claims more user’s attention.

**Disadvantages of horizontal form layout with left label alignment**

- It needs more horizontal space.
- It takes more time to complete (see the [research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php)).
- It is less suitable for multilingual interfaces.

### Horizontal form layout, right label alignment

**When to use?**

- The form is large and/or complex, and you need to slow the user down in order he/she вщ not make mistakes.
- Right alignment of labels visually better connects labels with inputs, in comparison with left alignment.

![labels near inputs example](static/label-4.png)

**Advantages of horizontal form layout with right label alignment**

- In view of visual connection between the label and the input this variant is better than the previous one.
- Higher results of filling rate, in comparison with the previous one (see the [research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php)).
- It can be more compact in comparison with the forms with vertical layout.

**Disadvantages of horizontal form layout with right label alignment**

- Such forms are more difficult to be scanned and read (labels are right aligned, user needs more time to find the beginning of the following line).
- It is less suitable for multilingual interfaces.
