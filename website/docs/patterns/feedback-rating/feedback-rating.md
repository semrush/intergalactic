## Description

**FeedbackRating** is a pattern for collecting feedback on a 5-rating scale from users.

Use it when you need to collect user's feedback after they performed specific step or used specific feature in the interface.

This pattern includes:

- [Notice](/components/notice/notice) with `info` theme and `SliderRating` that triggers modal window.
- Modal window with a form for specifying feedback.
- [NoticeBubble](/components/notice-bubble/notice-bubble-code#success-notice) for providing the success state after sending the data.
