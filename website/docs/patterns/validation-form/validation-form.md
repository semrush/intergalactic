## Description

**Validation** refers to the process of checking if the user's input is correct.

## How validation works

Input's validation can be performed two ways:

| Validation type | Description | Important notes |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| By `unFocus`    | Happens right away when user types something in the input and clicks outside it (`unFocus`). Input (or inputs) gets invalid state and become highlighted. When user focuses an invalid input, it shows tooltip with a message what should be fixed. | In this case avoid validating empty fields (where nothing has been typed) right after the user clicks outside them (`unFocus`). |
| By `submit` | Happens by submitting button (usually at the end of the form). Input (or inputs) gets invalid state and become highlighted. The first invalid input gets focus accompanied by a tooltip with a message what should be fixed. | For this case it's good to keep primary buttons active (not disable them). This way, users won't think the form or filter is broken. |



If the page is long, focusing on the initial input with an error should scroll the page to it. In such cases, a tooltip providing correction guidance should also be visible.

::: tip
If the form is long and the first invalid input is focused, the page should scroll to it and show a tooltip with a message what should be fixed.

The message should explain why the input is invalid or gives steps to fix it. Try to place the message close to the input and end it with a period.

### How invalid state is removed from input

- If the browser checks the input, the `invalid` state goes away as soon as the input is correct.
- If the server checks the input, the `invalid` state goes away each time the input is changed.

If user fixes inputs in a different order, all inputs that are still invalid will stay marked until they are changed.

## unFocus validation

Where deductions of paid limits and backend complexities are absent, immediate validation can be applied as users complete forms. Use this validation approach to facilitate form and filter completion. Displaying correction cues before submitting the form is recommended.

Where there's no need to consider limits or complex backend rules, check inputs right away as they are filled out. Use this method to help users complete forms and filters. It's better to show messages on how to correct inputs before user submits the form.

## Appearance

All form elements show an `invalid` state with a `var(--border-danger-active)` border. When focused, this state should trigger a tooltip with the `warning` theme.

## Notice with error message

For guidance on positioning the error message notice, refer to the [Notice](/components/notice/notice).

## Validation messages

A standard text pattern is: Please enter something.

Table: Validation messages

| Condition  | Text            |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Empty field | If referring to user data input, use: Please enter your [field name]. |
| Entering someone else's data | Use: Please enter a/an [field name].  |
| Field filled with erroneous data | For instance, with email field: Please enter a valid email. |
| Checkbox error for Terms & Conditions | Use: Please confirm that you agree to our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.   |
