@## Description

**Error message** is a component for displaying error message on the page. Use it for global error messages. Global errors is a pattern for pages blocking the user from working with the website, and informing why the system can't display the content. This pattern is also related to server errors, limitations, etc.

@## Appearance

Composition, styles, and margins of the message:

- For an image in svg format use `width: 240px`, `height: 240px`, `margin-right: 40px`.
- For title use text with 36px size (`--fs-700`, `--lh-700`), `--text-primary` color and `margin-bottom: 16px`.
- For message text use text with 14px size (`--fs-200`, `--lh-200`), `--text-primary` color and `margin-bottom: 24px`.
- For CTA use buttons with L size (optional).
- Captcha (optional).

> Be brief. Don't write too long message in the state description. Two or three small sentences usually are enough.

### Margins

- Margin between the illustration and the message is 40px.
- Maximum width of the message is 640px. Top margin of the container with the message is 32px.

### Positioning on the page

The message is centered horizontally and vertically. Give a container with an error message a relative height – `height: 70vh`.

### Appearance on small screens

For screens less than 768px:

- change layout of the message to vertical;
- change illustration's size to 200px * 200px;
- change margin between the illustration and a message from 40px to 8px;
- stretch controls to the width of the content.

**Title**

DNS resolution error

**Message**

You've requested a page on a website ([cloudflarepreview.com](http://cloudflarepreview.com/)) that is on the Cloudflare network. Cloudflare is currently unable to resolve your requested domain ([cloudflarepreview.com](http://cloudflarepreview.com/)). There are two potential causes of this:

- Most likely: if the owner just signed up for Cloudflare it can take a few minutes for the website's information to be distributed to our global network.

- Less likely: something is wrong with this site's configuration. Usually this happens when accounts have been signed up with a partner organization (e.g., a hosting provider) and the provider's DNS fails.

  - Ray ID: {000000000000000}

  - Timestamp: {Thu, 01-Jan-70 00:00:00 GMT}

  - Your IP address: {84.52.114.132}

  - Requested URL: {example.url/foo}

  - Error reference number: 1001

  - Server ID: {FL_FOO}

  - User-Agent: {Example}

@## Global errors usage

**When do we use it?**

In case of an error defined by the HTTP state code.

- DNS resolution error (1xx)
- Access denied – Access request (403)
- Page not found, Project not found (404)
- Connection lost (408)
- Something went wrong (500, 520)
- Connection timed out (522)

In case of a state caused by security reasons:

- Blocked request
- Confirmation

Additional situations where the state blocks all content and restricts access to it:

- Your account has been deleted
- Project not found
- Under maintenance
- Your payment cannot be accepted

### Use cases

There are two possible cases of the pattern's use:

- As a full-page for the whole website.
- As a state of the product.

> The location is the same in both cases: the placeholder is centered vertically and horizontally on the page.

| For the whole website                                | In the product                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

### Controls

1. If the error is processed by Cloudflare, we don't add buttons.
2. In other cases, it is recommended to add controls allowing the user:
   2.1 to leave the page:" Go to homepage";
   2.2 to take some actions to get rid of this state and load the page: "Reload page" / "Try again" / "Submit".
3. The "Contact us" button is only used for unexpected error states. In order that the user could contact support and report that something is not working.
