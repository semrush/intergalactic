@## Description

**Global errors** are pages blocking the user from working with the site, and informing why we can't display the content. They may also be related to server errors, limitations, etc.

@## Appearance

Composition, styles, and margins inside the error block:

- an image in svg format, `width: 240px; height: 240px; margin-right: 80px;`;
- the heading state, `h2 [--fs-700],$gray20`, `margin-bottom: 16px`;
- state description, `p â€” 14px [--fs-200], $gray20`, `margin-bottom: 24px;`;
- controls of size L (optional for some states);
- captcha (optional for some states).

> ðŸ’¡ Be brief. Don't write too much text in the state description. Two or three small sentences are enough.

### Spacing

- Padding between the illustration and the block with the content is 80px;
- The block width is not less than 320px, not more than 640px. There is a fixed spacing from the top edge of the box â€“ 32px.

### Positioning on the page

The block with an error is centered horizontally and vertically. A block that includes an error block is given a relative height â€” `height: height: 70vh;`.

@## DNS Resolution Error

![dns resolution error](static/ge_dns-resolution.png)

[Image source](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hXKRAyq23ETAVc3Y4a4h1fFOpJv6qqMb)

**Heading** â€” DNS resolution error

**Message**

You've requested a page on a website ([cloudflarepreview.com](http://cloudflarepreview.com/)) that is on the Cloudflare network. Cloudflare is currently unable to resolve your requested domain ([cloudflarepreview.com](http://cloudflarepreview.com/)). There are two potential causes of this:

- Most likely: if the owner just signed up for Cloudflare it can take a few minutes for the website's information to be distributed to our global network.

- Less likely: something is wrong with this site's configuration. Usually this happens when accounts have been signed up with a partner organization (e.g., a hosting provider) and the provider's DNS fails.

  - Ray ID: {000000000000000}

  - Timestamp: {Thu, 01-Jan-70 00:00:00 GMT}

  - Your IP address: {84.52.114.132}

  - Requested URL: {example.url/foo}

  - Error reference number: 1001

  - Server ID: {FL_FOO}

  - User-Agent: {Example}

@## Use of global errors

**When do we use it?**

In case of an error defined by the HTTP state code.

- DNS resolution error (1xx)
- Access denied â€” Access request (403)
- Page not found, Project not found (404)
- Connection lost (408)
- Something went wrong (500, 520)
- Connection timed out (522)

In case of a state caused by security reasons:

- Blocked request
- Confirmation

Additional situations where the state blocks all content and restricts access to it:

- Your account has been deleted
- Project not found
- Under maintenance
- Your payment cannot be accepted

### Use cases

Pages with global errors assume 2 options of use:

- As a full-page placeholder (leaving only the top menu and footer).
- As a placeholder on the product (leaving the top and left menus + footer). Used for products if only they have the error.

| On the full page                                     | On the product                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![global errors all page](static/ge_page-smthng.png) | ![global errors all page](static/ge_under-maintenance.png) |

> ðŸ’¡ The location is the same in both cases: the placeholder is centered vertically and horizontally in the area.

### Controls

1. If the error is processed by Cloudflare, we don't add buttons.
2. In other cases, it is recommended to add controls allowing the user:
   2.1 to leave the page: `Go to homepage`;
   2.2 to take some actions to get rid of this state and load the page: `Reload page`/`Try again`/`Submit`.
3. The `Contact us` button is only used for unexpected error states. In order that the user could contact support and notify us that something is not working. In cases where we anticipated an error here and know that this state is being displayed, the button is not needed.
