## Example of using templates

Both graphics and texts are already included in ready-to-use templates. The locale can be either got inside the component, or wrapped in an application `I18nProvider` from the `@react-semocre/utils` package, as in the example below.

## Example of using a custom error

You can create any error page. In the `Error` package, you will find the `getIconPath` feature, which will allow you to get the latest versions of icons. The list of potential icons is described in the [API](/patterns/global-errors/global-errors-api).
