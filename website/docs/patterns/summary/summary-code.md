@## Default summary example

@example simple-summary

@## Example of a vertical layout with skeleton

Yo can place main metrics vertically, if it's required by the report layout. Show [Skeleton](/components/skeleton/) on the first data download.

@example vertical-summary-with-skeleton

@## Summary with a minitrend

If the metrics don't fit into the maximum page width, arrange the data in a column — move the minitrends under the metric.

@example summary-with-minitrend

@## Summary with an error

@example summary-error
