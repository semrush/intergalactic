@## Description

**ProjectCreate** is a module for easy access to the project creation functionality on any Semrush product page.

See detailed information about the module in the [inner Figma library](https://www.figma.com/file/EWdX1ly5KsoNu8sywYJdKk/?node-id=39%3A18054).

@## Appearance

The module consists of:

- trigger (usually it is a button located in the upper-right corner of the product);
- modal window with a form.

### Trigger

The trigger must have a MathPlus icon with M size. It visually indicates the possibility of adding something.

For button label use the folliwing text: "Add new {Tool name}".

> ðŸ’¡ Note that if this button should have a lower priority in the visual hierarchy in your product, you can use the secondary button.

### Modal window

For form use inputs and controls with L size.

@## Interaction

> When the modal window opens, the first empty input gets the `focus` state. You can read more about the behavior of forms in the [Form guide](/components/form/).

If the user try to submit the form without the entered domain for the project, the input gets the `invalid` state. Focus moves to it and open the tooltip with an error message.

You can read more about form validation in the [Validation guide](/patterns/validation-form/).

@## Limit

In some cases, adding a project may be restricted for some reason (for example, due to a limit). In this situation, show a dropdown with the corresponding text and button.
