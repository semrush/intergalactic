@## Core libraries

If you're building an interface inside the Semrush suite, feel free to use our Figma libraries:

> Therefore, if you have a new illustration, pattern or email template, feel free to add them to the shared libraries. This will make it easier for your colleagues to find ready-to-use illustrations, icons and email templates in the future.
