@## Disabling overlay

By default, the component is rendered with an overlay, but you can change this by not passing it.

@## Portals

By default, the component is rendered to the portal, at the bottom of the body. You can redefine this behavior with [`PortalProvider`](/utils/portal/) and disable it with `disablePortal`.

@## Iframe

**We recommend not using this component inside an iframe.** Instead, use [modal window](/components/modal/) or [dropdown](/components/dropdown/).
