| Role     | Attribute                 | Element  | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `region` |                           | `div`    | Creates a landmark region that contains the currently expanded accordion panel.                                                                                                                                             |
| `button` |                           | `div`, `button` | The `button` role is for clickable elements that trigger a response when activated by the user. Adding `role="button"` tells the screen reader the element is a button, but provides no button functionality.               |
|          | `aria-expanded="true"`    | `button` | Set to `true` when the Accordion panel is expanded, otherwise set to `false`.                                                                                                                                               |
|          | `aria-controls="ID"`      | `button` | Points to the `ID` of the panel which the header controls.                                                                                                                                                                  |
|          | `aria-labelledby="IDREF"` | `div`    | Defines the accessible name for the region element. References the accordion header button that expands and collapses the region. `region` elements are required to have an accessible name to be identified as a landmark. |
|          | `aria-disabled`             |          | The `aria-disabled` state indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it isnâ€™t editable or otherwise operable. |

@## Considerations for developers

- Buttons are used as the accordions so that they are tab-able by keyboard users and accessible to screen readers.
- The accordion button should have an aria-controls attribute set to the `ID` of the element containing the accordion panel content.
- Each button has an aria-expanded attribute on it that is toggled between `true` and `false`. If `aria-expanded="true"`, the content associated with it is shown, and if `aria-expanded="false"` the content is hidden.
