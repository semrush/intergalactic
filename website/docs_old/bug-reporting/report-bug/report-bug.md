title: Bug reporting
---

Have you found a bug in one of our components and don't know where or to whom to report it? We have several ways to report bugs.

@## GitHub issues

You can submit a bug report or request an improvement with [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).

- This method is convenient for the developers and maintainers of the design system.
- It saves the history of changes and discussions related to all components.
- However, we understand it may be inconvenient for designers and other departments, as not everyone has a GitHub account. In this case check the following option.

@## Internal Slack channel

You can use the internal Slack channel (#ui-kit-team) to report and discuss bugs, improvements, and any other questions you want to address to the Semrush UI Kit Team.

- This method is convenient for Semrush developers and other maintainers, as it allows for quick feedback, bug fixes, and collaborative problem-solving.
- Note that Slack channel isn't very helpful in terms of saving history, so important discussions or decisions should be documented elsewhere for reference.
