Dynamic search searches as soon as at least one character is entered into the input.

@## Search by button

Slow but accurate user assistant, searches by button or by pressing `Enter`.

@## Search with select

An extremely rare dynamic search, we use it when fine-tuning of this filter is needed, since there is a lot of different kinds of data.

@example SearchWithSelect
