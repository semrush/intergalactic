@## Description

**SERP Features filter** is a filter to sort the data on the page by the SERP Features parameter.

You can select multiple values or "None", which will show all keywords without SERP Features.

**When working with SERP Features filter, it is important for the user to:**

- quickly understand it can choose one or several SERP Features;
- sort keywords with no SERP Features;
- quickly reset the entered data and search again;
- be able to select all SERP Features.

@## Appearance

### Trigger

- For trigger use [Select](/components/select/) and [FilterTrigger](/components/filter-trigger/) components.
- **Set the trigger min-width to 120px**. It's not recommended to make the trigger smaller. When there is enough space in the interface, make the width of the trigger dependent on the content, so the label inside the trigger doesn't have to be collapsed into the `ellipsis`.

### Dropdown

- Dropdown has the list of all SERP Features (23 for mobile and 22 for desktop).
- There is a special option - the ability to select keywords without SERP Features ("None").
- You cannot select both "None" and SERP Features.
- Add a search input to the list. Read more about the search in [Filter Search](/filter-group/filter-search/).
- Add **Select / Deselect all** option to the list.

**Don't make a dropdown width less than 224px**, otherwise, long SERP Features names can become unreadable after localization. If the SERP Feature name is too long, collapse into the `ellipsis`, and show its full name in the tooltip while hovering.

@## Interaction

- By default, nothing is selected in the filter.
- If user has selected a SERP feature, checkbox gets `active` state.
- Clicking on **Select all** selects all SERP features. After that the option changes to **Deselect all**.
- Since there can be many selected SERP features, don’t pin them after closing and reopening the dropdown.

Other rules for working and interacting with filters are described in the [Filter common rules guide](/filter-group/filter-rules/).
