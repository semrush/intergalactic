@## Default summary example

@example simple-summary

@## Vertical layout with skeleton

In case your report layout demands it, you have the option to vertically arrange the metrics. To enhance user experience during the initial data retrieval, consider displaying [Skeleton](/components/skeleton/).

@example vertical-summary-with-skeleton

@## Summary with minitrend

If the metrics are wider than the page's maximum width, a good approach is to organize them in columns. This means placing the minitrends below their corresponding metrics, ensuring a clear and visually appealing layout.

@example summary-with-minitrend

@## Summary with error

@example summary-error
