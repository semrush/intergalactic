> In the product interface we use a 12-column grid with a fixed 24px gutter between columns. The columns stretch.

@## Example use

The `Row` component accepts all the properties of the `Flex` component, and the `Col` component accepts all the properties of the `Box` component.

@## Automatic column size detection

@## Responsive

The grid has functionality for responsive layouts. You can change width and offsets of the columns depending on the screen size.

> The grid works as desktop first, as our core products are designed to work primarily on the desktop.

@## Responsive alternative API

We have added an alternative API for responsive grids. It's more laconic.
