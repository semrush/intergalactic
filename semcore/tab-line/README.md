  <summary>Alternative installation and use</summary>

**We do not recommend this usage path due to possible dependency and update issues.**

### Install

You can only install one package from the design system

```sh
npm install @semcore/tab-line @semcore/core
```

`@semcore/core` - _is the basic package by which we create our components, and it contains all of the common logic
of the components that is discussed below. There should only be one version of the package in the project._

</details>

### Usage

You can use the package the same way but without `/ui/` in the import path.

```jsx
import TabLine from '@semcore/tab-line';
```
