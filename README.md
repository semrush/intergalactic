Intergalactic is a constantly developing design system of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components, guidelines and UX patterns for buiding interfaces. You can explore components in our [documentation website](https://i.semrush.com).

---

## Features ‚ú®

- 80+ components for your design (you can also find them in the [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/@semrush))
- High-quality React components out of the box
- Written in TypeScript with predictable static types
- Whole package of design resources and development tools
- Powerful collection of charts
- Theme customization in every detail (find details in the [Design tokens guide](https://developer.semrush.com/intergalactic/style/design-tokens/))

## Browser Support

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Opera
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari (two last versions)

## Installation üõ†

```sh
pnpm add @semcore/ui
# or npm install @semcore/ui
```

After the installation, all components will be available at `@semcore/ui/{{component_name}}`.

### Package system

All components are located in the `@semcore` namespace in npm and are installed separately.

If the selected component is running, you must install the `@semcore/core package`.

Example:

```
npm i @semcore/button @semcore/core
```

`@semcore/core` is the basic package with which we create our components, and it contains all of the common logic of the components that is discussed below. There should be only one version of the package in the project.
