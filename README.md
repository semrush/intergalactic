## Before you start

This repository is a single development point for all library components. Each component is a separate package located in the `@semcore` namespace.

You can add our components to your project using any package manager.

## Installation üõ†

The library supports two delivery systems:

- Package system where each individual component is a separate package
- Release system where all components are combined in a single package

We recommend you using the release system, since it's more convenient and it reduces the risk of bundle bloat due to package duplicates. With the release system, you can also install component packages separately if you need to.

### Release system

Components are installed in a single package.

Example:

```
npm i @semcore/ui
```

After the installation, all components will be available at `@semcore/ui/{{ component name }}`.

### Package system

All components are located in the `@semcore` namespace in npm and are installed separately.

If the selected component is running, you must install the `@semcore/core package`.

Example:

```
npm i @semcore/button @semcore/core
```

`@semcore/core` is the basic package with which we create our components, and it contains all of the common logic of the components that is discussed below. There should be only one version of the package in the project.
