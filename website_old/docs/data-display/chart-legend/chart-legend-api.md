### Legend

```js
import { Legend } from '@semcore/chart';
```

We took the standard `Legend` component from [recharts](http://recharts.org/) as a basis and upgraded it a little 💪 , but it still works with the native [API](http://recharts.org/en-US/api/Legend).

### Legend.Controls

```js
import { Legend } from '@semcore/chart';
```

To facilitate adding of properties to controls, the are arranged in a separate component.
